AWD-002228,2023,Risk and Emergency Management,Firewise Communities Microgrant Program ,CA,06057,Nevada County,"In rural, forested Nevada County, 92% of the nearly 100,000 residents live in high to very high fire hazard severity zones. Fire prevention experts, local government leaders, and the public at large agree that one of the most significant threats to human life is the need to safely evacuate during a wildfire. The major barrier to safe evacuations stems from the abundance of flammable vegetation on private lands and along private roadways. 
Private properties have historically been a missing piece to this wildfire preparation and evacuation puzzle. The “Firewise Communities Microgrant Program” was designed to address reducing the fuel load to improve evacuation safety. 
Funded with a $100,000 grant from a local community foundation, the County established the Firewise Communities Microgrant Program, which made 26 grants of $3,600 each to recognized Firewise Communities. Eligible projects to reduce wildfire risk included increasing defensible space around homes, removing hazardous vegetation from private lands, and clearing evacuation routes on private roadways. 
This program is the first of its kind for Firewise Communities. Nevada County has the most recognized Firewise Communities for any county in the nation. This program was able to leverage these communities’ volunteerism for maximum impact. This ultimately created a more wildfire resilient landscape that will save lives and property.

These areas could benefit from focused initiatives by the County and its partners.

The plan organizes connectivity gaps based on low access and low adoption rates, including infrastructure, and ranks recommended prioritization by census tract. The plan can serve as a foundational resource as the County and its partners continue efforts to close the digital divide. Lack of broadband connectivity impacts many San Diego communities throughout the region and while the County’s efforts are focused in the unincorporated areas, its partnerships can help close those connectivity gaps regionwide.

AWD-002295,2023,Community and Economic Development,SUBCONTRACTOR DISCLOSURE,CA,06073,San Diego County,"The County works to create a culture of safety and legal compliance by ensuring that labor standards are upheld. The construction lifecycle typically includes a single prime contractor who employs multiple subcontractors for individual construction tasks. Existing federal and state laws ensure transparency and labor standards for prime contractors. Under these existing laws, the County verifies that prime contractors are in good standing with the Contractors State Licensing Board (CSLB) at the time of building permit issuance; however, existing laws are not applicable and need more transparency for the thousands of subcontractors locally. This policy gap provided local policy opportunities to create new policies, processes, and electronic solutions to add disclosures as a local ordinance requirement. 

The  County’s updated ordinances require contractors to disclose information for their subcontractors working on projects requiring County building permits and right-of-way permits in the unincorporated communities (where the County has land use jurisdiction). The program applies to certain private construction projects and those within the right-of-way. The program outcome improves transparency and equity by leveling the playing field for businesses, helping improve worker safety on job sites, and capturing key data to guide future policy decisions within the County.

The audits performed include statutory, risk-based internal controls, and information systems audits. 

The County’s operating environment and services are becoming increasingly sophisticated as more regulations are introduced without the necessary funding sources to facilitate compliance efforts. As innovative auditing techniques are being developed, internal audit groups can improve their effectiveness by increasing their audit coverage. This can be achieved by implementing continuous auditing and monitoring techniques to detect exceptions in real-time and allow auditors to review entire populations, rather than sampling.  

REC is required to audit property tax refunds issued by the Travis County Tax Assessor-Collector’s Office throughout the year. On average, the volume of these property tax refunds has been increasing by 25% annually since 2018.  The review process for these refunds requires significant resources, and the increasing volume of refunds has stretched REC’s resources.  To meet this challenge, advanced analytics and automation processes were implemented to reduce the number of auditing hours required for this audit by as much as 91%.

Purchasing along with the Auditor-Controller/Treasurer/Tax Collector (ATC), and the SAP Team,  recommended establishing a secondary card limited for travel to assist the County with tracking and reconciling travel related expenses. The New Travel Card program is an extension of the Procurement Card (CAL-Card) through US Bank.

Several controls, including the use of Merchant Category Codes (MCC), have been deployed for CAL-Card. These controls ensure that a card is used for authorized purchases within specific dollar and transaction quantity limits. Certification of all purchases by each cardholder is required monthly with verification performed by the Approving Official and final review by ATC. The Purchasing Department also reviews department purchases for compliance with purchasing policy.

With the implementation of SAP, CAL-Card, and temporary Visa charges for ""County Paid"" travel expenses are recorded in the SAP travel module. Purchases that are not captured in the travel module are processed in a lump sum to the bank and must be reconciled and redistributed to the proper expense account and cost object monthly. As a result of having travel activity recorded within SAP and purchasing activity updated at a later point in time, the reconciliation process for CAL-Card packages has become cumbersome and inefficient.

The Compassionate Leadership through a Trauma-Informed Lens Toolkit is an interactive, discussion-based guide of actionable behaviors for supervisors. During a two-hour workshop, facilitators use the Toolkit to guide supervisors through a trauma-informed approach to promote safety, trust, choice, empowerment, and collaboration with their staff. This approach creates a culture of belonging and safety.

The interactivity provides experience practicing with peers and fostering a trauma-informed approach toward managing. After 100 participants, surveys indicated that 90% of respondents agreed that the workshop has better equipped them to using the Toolkit in conversations with staff, and 100% agreed that the role-playing scenarios and exercises facilitated their learning. This success is driving departments to request Toolkit training and a train-the-trainer program to increase access.

Using an innovative and inclusive procurement strategy, the Department of Purchasing and Contracting (DPC) and Department of General Services (DGS) ensured that the County of San Diego’s new Southeastern Live Well Center (SELWC) would be built with both input from the community and construction participation by local businesses and workers. These efforts resulted in a contract commitment requiring $6 million community investment through local subcontracting and workforce opportunities and a 5% local workforce participation goal.

The SELWC is a 65,000 square foot administrative building that will serve as a hub for health and social services in Southeastern San Diego. Southeastern San Diego is widely viewed as one of the most diverse areas in the city and roughly represents four zip codes: 92102, 92113, 92114 and 92139. The residents and businesses located in these communities have been historically underrepresented and underutilized in government contracting and workforce opportunities. DPC and DGS utilized this innovative and inclusive procurement strategy to ensure that the construction of the new SELWC would reverse this trend and provide employment and construction opportunities for participation within these zip codes and the region.

ABS recognizes that the hospitality industry has been hit especially hard by the pandemic and continues to struggle with supply chain disruptions, a labor shortage, inflation, and changed customer expectations for dining and entertainment. Because of this, ABS met license holders and facility managers where they were, both physically and conceptually, to assess evolving trends and needs as well as to provide information to the licensed establishments. Notably, many license holders responded that the personal visit was a big and important step in bolstering communications, even when they did not have particular concerns to report. Using a conversational approach with a trusted interviewer, ABS was able to extract meaningful data that would not be accessible through online surveys or public focus groups.

The in-person visits helped to identify and update alcohol policy, trainings, and resources for licensees and their staff, and they confirmed that many of ABS’s health, safety, and compliance programs are working. ABS recognizes that a robust control system is the healthiest and safest model for communities and sees improvements to all aspects of its business model as a way of safeguarding the health and welfare of the community. In general, ABS learned from the customer engagement and outreach program that license holders make good use of the department’s two main teaching tools: the annual wall calendar and the twice-monthly regulatory training class. In addition, license holders are looking for enhanced customer service at the ABS retail stores and find their delivery drivers to be a key resource.

Despite being critically important, such linkages often are not realized due to requirements to protect personal-identifying and protected health information. To share elements needed for linking person-level data between datasets (e.g., name, date-of-birth, Social Security Number) appropriate protections and agreements are needed; sometimes, despite much discussion, data are determined to be too high-risk, and trust cannot be utilized for data sharing. Software has been developed by vendors that creates encrypted combinations of record-linkage fields that are one-way (hashed values can’t be reversed). Vendor systems are expensive to use, often come with license restrictions that require additional fees for partners, can be complicated to execute, and linkages among individuals of low socio-economic status (SES) or with cultural diversity are less accurate. 

At Cook County Health, we developed an open source, state-of-the art privacy preserving record (PPRL) software system, Linkja, with novel rules that improve the accuracy of record linkages for low SES populations. We have used Linkja to join health system, public health, homeless management information system, adult probation and other health system datasets.

Residents can browse the requests, use the search engine built into the application or the County’s search engine. 
The system is designed to allow the resident to submit requests or employees to submit requests on behalf of the resident.  The system has a self-contained communication system that allows email and text notifications on the status of the request to be sent to the resident.  If the resident needs to supply additional information, they can connect to the County web site and update their request.
The solution was piloted in 2021 and has been in production through 2022.  The primary department using the solution in 2022 is the department of Revenue.  Other departments and services are being added in 2023.  In 2022, over 34,000 customer requests were captured by the system.  Of those, almost 7,000 requests needed to be tracked through to resolution.
All the activity on a request is tracked through the database.  This allows managers to understand the workload of the staff and identify if additional staff is needed or if staff needs to be shifted across functions to better serve the resident.

The result is 13 synthetic turf fields, including a standalone championship field with permanent seating for 500 spectators, and an oversized natural grass Super Pitch. Beyond the fields, the complex affords visitors ample concessions, restrooms, and lighted parking areas along with new park trail to Creve Coeur Lake.  There are more than 1,200 paved parking spots with more than 300 overflow grass spots available. Event merchandising vendors are accounted for with an expansive concrete area, dedicated Wi-Fi and electricity that they can provide tournament amenities from for visitors in the Central Village. Additionally, dedicated fiber-based bandwith enables livestreaming on the Championship Field along with a PA system and digital scoreboard. The 110-acre complex footprint sits on the western edge of Creve Coeur Memorial Lake inside St. Louis County’s largest park. 

The purpose of the complex was to reimagine existing park space to fill a strong local demand for game, training and tournament space for St. Louis’ robust youth soccer landscape and to make St. Louis’ central location in the Midwest a destination site for regional and national events. 

The outcome has seen Creve Coeur Park Soccer Complex flourish in filling its purpose locally, regionally and nationally as it has established itself as an epicenter of soccer play in its first five years of operation, regularly hosting US Youth Soccer regional championships, an ECNL national championship, Missouri Youth Soccer Association (MYSA) State Cups, college soccer, MLS Next Pro professional and MLS Next academy training and games among other events all resulting in a major new positive economic impact on the area.

This RNG produced from landfill biogas is sold as vehicle fuel offsetting greenhouse gas emissions and generating revenue and renewable energy credits for the County. This project has gained national recognition for its addition of an innovative offload station that enhances equity and inclusion around who is able to access renewable energy markets. The RNG offload station allows other bio-gas producers in the area, such as dairy farmers, to access the pipeline and renewable energy markets that would otherwise be impractical to pursue. Since its inception, the RNG facility has generated renewable natural gas equivalent to 4,800,000 gallons of gasoline and over $4 million in net profit that goes back to Dane County’s general funds to support other County services. Regional biogas producers have contributed an additional 2,800,000 gallons of gasoline worth of RNG to the renewable energy market by using the offload station.

By listening to our hiring managers and using continuous process improvement tools to cut redundancy in our recruitment process, we successfully reduced our time to hire from 130 days (or higher!) to 60 days (or less). We not only got bodies in seats faster, but we infused the process with techniques to help sharpen managers’ skillset in selecting the best fitting candidate.

While federal eviction moratoriums provided temporary respite, the cessation of moratoriums left residents confronting threats of eviction and accompanying emotional and psychological stresses. The County established multiple emergency rental assistance programs, leading the coordination with state and city programs to address every housing instability component:  Homeless Services, Crisis Shelter, Utility Payments, Debt Relief Counseling and Eviction Prevention. The County also established a unique court-based program, which situated case managers within the courts to directly support eviction applicants. 
The results were an unmitigated success – the state courts emphasized that this aid helped subvert thousands of evictions (>4,000) and thwarted a likely state housing crisis, while creating a new model of support for the future. The minority and low-income communities were those that received overwhelming support, representing approximately 80% of applications serviced, with an average Area Median Income (AMI) below 25%.

The Segmentation Tool has been instrumental in allowing case managers to more efficiently work their cases, resulting in better case work and an improved customer experience for our case participants.",Awarded

The home test kits are easy to use and can be self-administered, with results available within 15 minutes. By providing these kits to the community, the centers are helping to increase access to COVID-19 testing and encouraging early detection. 

The distribution of home test kits by Community and Senior Centers is an innovative approach to help control the spread of COVID-19. By prioritizing access to testing for their members, these centers are playing a critical role in reducing transmission rates and preventing future outbreaks.

Overall, the distribution of home test kits by Community and Senior Centers is a positive development in the fight against COVID-19. It provides a convenient and accessible testing option for individuals who may not be able to access traditional testing centers and/or home testing kits helping to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to protect themselves and their communities.

The series aims to shift perception of the County as a byzantine bureaucracy by spotlighting the downstream effects of programs and policies as they are implemented, evolved and impact real lives — giving clients a platform to share their stories of resilience, survival and success while educating the public on the value of public social services.

AWD-002537,2023,Information Technology,LA County Digital Media Waiver Platform,CA,06037,Los Angeles County,"The LA County Digital Media Waiver Platform is an innovative and all-inclusive photo and waiver management system, built in-house, to eliminate the need for physical paper signatures, reduce tedious administrative tasks, standardize waiver processes across departments, and create a centralized and searchable library of waivered images and b-roll videos for County Departments, agencies, and media to access. The LA County Chief Executive Office collaborated with the Internal Services Department (ISD) and County Counsel to develop a first-of-its-kind waiver and photo management platform. By scanning a unique QR code on their mobile device, users access the digital waiver on a web or mobile browser, where they are prompted to select a language and are then guided through the form step by step. Upon digitally signing and submitting the waiver, users receive an emailed copy of the waiver language. If a user does not complete their waiver, the record is marked pending in the backend and an administrator can easily send a reminder email. After submitting, a digital record is automatically created on the backend and the signed waiver can be grouped into an event and linked to photos of the subject. Once associated with a signed waiver, the image appears in a searchable photo library. Photos in this library can be easily shared externally as an album or downloaded individually. The platform is a multi-tenant cloud application built to scale, allowing all County departments to use it—standardizing the County’s media waiver process for everyone. The platform has become an indispensable tool in sharing the County’s story, in a highly visual way, with the public across multiple platforms. ",Awarded
AWD-002539,2023,Health,Los Angeles County Outpatient Conservatorship Program,CA,06037,Los Angeles County,"Mental Health Conservatorships in California are traditionally established by a referral from an acute psychiatric facility for an individual who is involuntarily detained because he/she is gravely disabled.  Grave disability is defined as the inability to provide for your food, clothing or shelter due to a mental illness.  Acute psychiatric facilities are designated to send referrals to the County Conservatorship Investigator, the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) in the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health.  While California law allowed for a conservatorship to be established on an outpatient basis, there was no process by which a referral could be successfully submitted to OPG.  The Outpatient Conservatorship Pilot Program designated the Homeless Outreach Mobile Engagement (HOME) Team to submit referrals for conservatorship without requiring the subject of the referral to be hospitalized.  The HOME team and OPG office established a collaborative committee to develop program guidelines, develop training and met weekly to review potential candidates for conservatorship investigation.  The pilot ensured that all alternatives to conservatorship were considered but advanced innovative strategies such as court testimony via video from the streets, testimony from the psychiatrist with a long standing relationship with the client to avoid hearsay testimony, and avoided the trauma of a hospitalization. After demonstrating outpatient conservatorships could be obtained, the pilot program was transitioned to an ongoing program with the expansion of HOME to become a comprehensive program serving the entire County with designation as a referral source for conservatorships.

Sessions were scheduled to intentionally begin with a diverse sampling of residents and those with lived expertise; the concepts they raised were built upon so that their voices would be the most influential and powerful in shaping the ideas in the framework.  The resulting framework presented a clear vision and pathway for alleviating poverty that was digestible, and that others could join to create a collective energy for achieving results.  The PAI secured commitments from 25 partners to help implement five initiatives and recruited partners to lead 18 other initiatives identified in the framework.  The initiative has committed to challenging the assumptions that allow us to accept poverty as a ‘given,’ and truly disrupt its cycle.

Most mpox cases were in individuals who identified as Latino/x or Black/African American; however individuals in these groups were receiving the vaccine at a lower rate than their White and Asian counterparts. Identifying vaccine disparities and ensuring equitable vaccine access for residents at highest risk for mpox has been a key strategy of the County’s mpox vaccination efforts. Key strategies have leveraged existing partnerships with community health clinics and community-based organizations to raise mpox awareness, promote vaccine utilization among affected community members, and facilitate vaccine access. Community-driven partnerships with vaccine providers across public and private health care providers, mobile vaccine clinics that bring vaccine to the community, and novel communications tools, are needed to respond effectively and equitably to an outbreak.",Awarded

A general lack of awareness about bat rabies is a public health issue which results in preventable rabies exposures, increased medical costs, and the lack of preventive measures such as pet immunization and bat exclusion from homes. A 2017 survey of local veterinarians demonstrated that they were also unaware that rabid bats had been detected near 85% of clinics in the previous decade. In 2018, VPH developed a targeted outreach and education campaign to increase awareness of bat rabies and inform about steps people could take to reduce risk. The goals were to:
1)	Educate residents in neighborhoods where a rabid bat was found, and 
2)	Contact veterinary practices within five miles to request assistance with public education about the rabid bats and encourage clients to keep their pet’s rabies immunizations up to date.  

The outreach effort led to an increase in bats being tested and found rabid, general awareness about bat rabies, and a reduction of people handling bats with their bare hands.

In response to these dual issues, the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health (DPH) partnered with a technology-based company that created a mobile food recovery app to facilitate the donation of surplus food to communities in need. DPH collaborated with the Department of Public Works to raise awareness of the project among food businesses seeking to reduce their organic waste in order to comply with state Senate Bill 1383 (now California's Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Strategy). As part of this joint effort, DPH conducted outreach via its Environmental Health food inspectors and Nutrition and Physical Activity Program to encourage enrollment into the project. The funding, which was provided by the County of Los Angeles Quality and Productivity Commission, helped to onboard 50 businesses and schools, rescuing 102,000 lbs. of food equivalent to approximately 84,900 meals directly delivered to clients by nonprofit organizations that provide social services and meals programming.

The application's user-friendly interface and intuitive design made it easy for voters to create a custom plan based on their preferred voting option and to stay informed throughout the voting period. The MAPTV application was a highly effective tool in driving civic engagement and voter participation. By capturing voter preferences and providing personalized notifications via email and text message, the application empowered citizens to take an active role in the democratic process and make informed decisions at the ballot box.
Throughout the campaign, over 108,000 users visit the planning tool and 45% completed making their plan. More than 43,000 emails and SMS were delivered to those voters who engaged with the tool and provided timely and relevant information that was necessary based on the election timeline.

These sites served as a trusted community resource in specific underserved communities and created an accessible “one-stop shop” for nearby residents to receive community health services. In addition to providing COVID-19 vaccinations, supplemental services were offered including flu and mpox vaccinations, COVID-19 test kit distributions, rapid COVID-19 onsite antigen testing and therapeutics referrals, a produce pick-up program, and additional psychosocial resources such as on-site mental health workshops and other enrollment services. Community outreach and vaccinations on-the-spot at nearby local venues via our “Vax-on-the-Go""(VOTG) initiative engaged the hard-to-reach and vaccine hesitant populations.

As of early February 2023, LACDPH’s community PODs have administered over 182,000 COVID-19 vaccines, more than 40,000 mpox vaccines, and over 19,000 flu vaccines.

In 2021, LAC had 123 infants who were diagnosed with congenital syphilis (CS) and 18 syphilitic stillbirths. Suboptimal syphilis screening among people who could become pregnant, particularly those not receiving regular healthcare services, was identified as a key contributor to CS. LAC’s Department of Public Health’s (LAC DPH) Prevention and Outreach to Women at Elevated Risk (POWER) project set out to identify non-traditional syphilis screening models to test and treat women of reproductive age with undiagnosed syphilis who may not otherwise be tested in routine healthcare settings. DPH partnered with County agencies and community-based organizations (CBO) serving women with substance use disorder (SUD), experiencing mental health challenges or experiencing homelessness to provide HIV and syphilis testing and treatment to these women and their partners.

AWD-002589,2023,County Administration and Management,Automated and Expanded Residential Walk-Through Online Permitting Process,MD,24027,Howard County,"Howard County had a very successful Residential Walk-Through program.  This program allowed for the quick application, review, and approval of miscellaneous residential projects, such as: swimming pools and hot tubs; decks and sunporches; small additions; etc.  The program accounted for over 40% of the permits issued in a typical week.  However, the program only operated for a two-hour period, twice weekly.  This led to staff falling behind on other required tasks, as well as putting homeowners (who need a little more attention), competing with professional contractors for time and resources.  

The solution was to redevelop the program to take full advantage of available technology.  We automated the permitting process for these types of activities, requiring the licensed Maryland Home Improvement Contractors (MHIC) to become registered users and trained them to be able to apply online 24/7, while still allowing homeowners to apply in-person anytime during normal business hours (homeowners are also able to apply online if they so desire).

This process previously involved printing volumes of responsive documents from DILP’s database, scanning them, then submitting them to our Public Information Office (PIO).  The printed documents were required to be maintained in storage boxes as per our records retention schedule.  This all was very costly due to printing paper and supplies, wear and tear on equipment, storage space, as well as staff time.  

As of late 2022, this MPIA process is almost entirely processed and maintained electronically.  Responsive documents are downloaded from our database and emailed directly to the PIO personnel to respond.  The emails, as well as the responsive records are then maintained on a shared network drive and filed by address for ease of searching.  

This new electronic process significantly reduces the amount of paper used as well as storage space required to maintain the records for the specified retention schedule period.

Despite the 2020 election being called “the most secure election in American history” by federal election infrastructure officials, there were still claims of widespread voter fraud which were rejected by the FBI, the Department of Justice, and various courts across the nation. Unfortunately, due to the persistent nature of the MDM being peddled on many types of media, national polls indicate that a segment of American society continues to believe the 2020 Presidential Election was “stolen.” Ongoing MDM campaigns have misguided the public with unfounded, baseless claims regarding election and voting systems eroding trust, faith, and confidence in elections. Democracy is fragile and public trust in elections is essential to, and the hallmark of, a well-functioning government and society.

The county commission decided a major change needed to occur to help the smaller municipalities from feeling weighed down, and so the commissioners created the Audrain County Municipalities Program. In the spring of 2022, the commission held the inaugural meeting. The concept was simple: discuss matters important to the communities, communicate information from the county level to the municipalities, network, brainstorm, and share resources.  The group decided at that meeting to convene every two months at a revolving location so each municipality could host.

AWD-002620,2023,County Administration and Management,OC Public Works Project Delivery Manual (PDM),CA,06059,Orange County,"OC Public Works (OCPW), a department of the County of Orange, California, created the Project Delivery Manual (PDM) to document the complete project delivery process, from Initiation Phase to Close Out Phase, and to ensure OCPW project managers have the tools to manage their assigned projects efficiently and effectively. 

OCPW project managers are separated into “vertical” teams who work on County buildings and facilities and “horizontal” teams who work on public infrastructure such as roads, bikeways and flood control channels. The PDM aligned project delivery processes across vertical and horizontal teams, brought uniformity and consistency to project management, and helped build stronger collaboration (e.g., best practices, lessons learned) across teams. 

OCPW’s PDM took an innovative approach by serving as a web-based, centralized repository for processes, reference manuals, forms, and other materials that were once spread across various teams and difficult to find or locate. Many staff were unaware these resources existed prior to the PDM. The PDM made staff access to critical project information easier and faster.

The PDM is also used as an on-boarding and training tool for new project managers and engineers. OCPW holds monthly PDM training classes which are open to project managers, staff who are interested in a future career in project management, and staff who simply want to learn more about the project delivery process.

The ISW:SB-SBIRT identifies this need through the implementation of a universal screening tool that provides a snapshot of the overall wellbeing of middle school and high school aged youth using an evidence-based questionnaire. Results from the screening survey are compiled and students are assigned a risk category based on various factors, including immediate risk and physiological needs. Follow up is provided to any youth identified at risk or requesting follow up, including mental health treatment services when necessary, until referred to an outpatient provider. All services provided by the ISW program are available to any youth within the participating schools, regardless of insurance coverage or ability to pay. Through the ISW program, Spokane County seeks to change the approach to youth mental health treatment, recognizing the importance of preventative treatment through implementing targeted upstream interventions to address emerging challenges, while ensuring critical treatment services to address immediate mental health needs.

AWD-002716,2023,Human Services,Culturally Specific Mental Health Services,MN,27053,Hennepin County,"National and local research has demonstrated that in most communities across the nation, inequities have persisted over time across racial and ethnic groups in both access to behavioral health supports and behavioral health outcomes. In Minnesota, communities of color consistently access supports at lower rates than their White counterparts, and consequentially, communities of color experience mental health challenges at disproportionately higher rates and for longer periods of time. At the root of these disparities, behavioral health systems have historically prioritized funding for, and centered policy design around, westernized approaches to care. More equitable behavioral health systems require both flexible definitions of mental health and integrated, culturally specific models of care. Towards this end, Hennepin County partnered with more than 20 culturally specific mental health providers serving 15 cultural groups across the county in 2022. Nearly all of these providers accessed County funding for the first time through this initiative. As of December 2022, 1,400 residents have newly accessed culturally specific mental health supports through this initiative and more than 19,000 residents have been engaged. Through low-barrier contracting and flexible service designs, new models of care have been seeded and existing culturally specific models have expanded to reach more county residents.",Awarded

CFS sought to secure shift differentials which would align with other shift differentials throughout San Bernardino County. The goal was to motivate staff members who extend themselves past their normal working hours to assist with the supervision of youth who are staying in CFS regional offices overnight.

The shift differential alleviates the difficulties of CFS finding staff who will come back to work after working their regular shift to provide overnight supervision for youth temporarily staying in CFS offices. Additionally, the shift differential provides an appealing incentive that motivates staff to spend their time outside normal working hours to provide the best level of support to youth who are under the care of CFS.

The purpose was to migrate from the outdated Mobility Services passenger information table that used an Access database into new technology.  Updating to current technology would automate the process of creating ridership information lending to history being captured and reports created. The second part of the program was to be able to create the ability to validate payment requests submitted by ride vendors through the new technology. Beginning with the ridership and moving to the invoice reconciliation being done by a computer has been extremely beneficial to the department.

The outcome has been successful in every way. Passenger registration is streamlined into a system that must be filled out correctly with the proper information and cautions staff when a rider is in the program to avoid redundancy. This program is not limited by the amount of information it can handle and includes several places to add notes which allows staff to record a history of rider updates. Invoice validation is accurate to the penny checking the costs of the vendor’s transportation fees.

AWD-002754,2023,Civic Education and Public Information,Chesterfield On Point Blog,VA,51041,Chesterfield County,"Chesterfield Communications and Media formally launched the county’s official blog, Chesterfield On Point, in October 2021 as part of an effort to communicate directly with residents through a new medium and disseminate vital information in a fact-based and unbiased manner.

Despite being the fastest-growing locality in the Richmond region and the fourth-largest county in Virginia, with an estimated population of 370,000, Chesterfield faces a challenging media environment. Staffing cutbacks at the region’s daily newspaper have had an adverse effect on the quality of its coverage, while both of the county’s weekly newspapers have stopped printing. That mostly leaves coverage to our three TV stations, all of which tend to hire young, inexperienced reporters who are new to the area.  

Chesterfield On Point blog has proven to be an important resource for the county government in providing depth, background and historical context to both residents and local media. The blog grew quickly from biweekly posting to weekly and now publishes multiple posts in the same week as needed. It has become a go-to source for Chesterfield news and information about the county’s many programs, services and events, and a valuable tool for educating residents about complex topics.

Designed specifically to meet employee needs, the Collaborative Work Centers provide two locations within the county where employees from any department can gather, collaborate, or work individually.

The idea for the Collaborative Work Center originated in the fall of 2020, when early in the COVID pandemic, a team of Facility Services architectural and design subject matter experts asked themselves “what should our post-pandemic office environment look like?”.

To answer the question, the team followed a structured process that began with an environmental scan of data and publications related to real estate, architecture, interior design, employee wellness, technology, and work styles. Next, they applied what they learned to Hennepin County’s culture and core values. Collaborative Work Centers successfully align Facility Services activity based work environment principles with the county vision for Future of Work. The CWC’s are purposefully designed to: 
•	support a workforce that includes remote, hybrid and onsite employees,
•	provide the tools, technologies and equipment needed to deliver work,
•	inspire employees to represent the culture and values of Hennepin County, and
•	create an inviting sense of place where employees can collaborate, connect and engage with one another.

North Regional is the second largest public library in Minneapolis.  

The redesign created a balance of quiet and collaborative zones, while improving programmatic adjacencies.  Energy-efficiency upgrades brought a 21% reduction in electricity consumption, with a 1.6-year payback.

Unique to the project was the role throughout design of youth from Juxtaposition Arts (JXTA), a nonprofit youth art and design education center in North Minneapolis. The architect subcontracted JXTA to provide community engagement and targeted design services, including patterns and motifs that were incorporated into wall coverings, window films, decorative fencing, bike racks, concrete paving and large-format sound absorption panels. 

The JXTA partnership enhanced community engagement in valuable ways.  Many of the young consultants (aged 14 to 21) were BIPOC youth who live in the community the library serves.  They were able to reach a younger and more diverse section of the community than typically reached by more traditional weekday evening community engagement meetings.  Without their creativity and follow through, fewer voices would have been heard. The redesigned library is all the better for incorporating diverse perspectives.

Often the bathroom in a public building is the only safe space for victims of domestic abuse or human trafficking. This pilot program targeted four of the county’s busiest buildings including the Hennepin County Government Center and Hennepin County Central Library. County security staff, working with community partners like No Wrong Door and survivor groups, implemented two solutions, including one-way emergency phones and signage in four languages with tear-off slips that could be handed to any county employee. Security communicated broadly about the pilot project and provided training to over 1000 county employees, so any county staff who received the tear-off slip would be prepared to respond.

In just the first four months of the pilot, the Security Division received seventeen human trafficking and domestic violence calls and was able to respectfully and safely connect those victims with Hennepin County resources.

In the summer of 2020, the building, which was closed due to COVID, was damaged by civil unrest after the murder of George Floyd. The Hennepin Healthcare East Lake clinic, located two blocks away, was also heavily damaged and closed. 

Due to the changing nature of work, the county was able to reduce its presence in the building, and Hennepin Healthcare relocated its clinic to the Hennepin County Human Services Center (HCSC).  Additionally, the county took this opportunity to relocate the Mental Health clinic from a nearby leased location to co-locate with the East Lake Clinic.  During this time, the county finished the new farmer’s market location, called Market Plaza, and welcomed a third minority-owned tenant to the commercial space on the ground floor.

AWD-002788,2023,Information Technology,IT’s Redesign of Bureau of Utilities’ Landing Page,MD,24027,Howard County,"After receiving a request in March of 2022 from the Bureau of Utilities regarding the visibility of the “Report an Issue” link, the Department of Technology and Communication Systems (DTCS) conducted a review of the Bureau’s pages to determine the root cause and better address the problem. The conclusion was that the Bureau’s pages did not give each important function its own space, which caused problems with usability and search engine visibility and failed to properly direct users. To solve this, the Utilities landing page was heavily reworked to behave as a hub page for users, with new pages created for frequently used Public Water & Sewer resources. These resources can now be found directly via search engines, and reporting utility issues is now significantly easier for constituents, which in turn allows the Bureau to respond to these issues more promptly. This new version of the Utilities site was officially launched on October 11, 2022.

This placed residents at high risk of losing their housing.  The eviction moratorium was a short-term solution to what is now a crisis. Large overdue rental balances and a lack of affordable housing have increased the rate of evictions which are now flooding local court calendars.  

In anticipation of the changing economic landscape once the moratorium ended, in July 2021, Hennepin County Adult Representation Services (ARS) launched a Housing Court team to provide legal representation to tenants experiencing poverty.  Our interdisciplinary team works together to provide high-quality representation and wraparound support to tenants. 

Currently, 100% of clients experiencing poverty have been offered legal representation on eviction matters in Hennepin County. In 2022, ARS served nearly 2,500 tenants, 76% of whom are Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC). Tenants who are represented have better outcomes that include favorable settlements, securing additional rental assistance and expungement of their eviction record. This creates long-term housing stability for Hennepin County residents and advances Hennepin County’s mission to improve racial equity and support the well-being of all residents.

Many pre-pandemic business practices needed to be revamped to accommodate the new needs of our employees and customers. Drastic changes were made to existing business practices related to collections on past due accounts. During the pandemic, customer past due balances grew due to a state enacted disconnection moratorium. When the moratorium ended, funds from Utility Assistance Program and ARPA federal programs were applied to past due accounts, according to program guidelines. Once federal assistance ended, customers were made aware collections would resume on past due balances. With our customers in mind and the high past due balances, we proposed the concept of payment plans for customers unable to pay their bills during the pandemic.

Strategic planning means having a strategic perspective for one’s business, a vision for the future, which will give the organization a competitive advantage and the right tools to take necessary actions to always keep the organization successful with the customers in mind.

This program was administered by the local Social Services department in determining the qualifications of the applicant.

AWD-002803,2023,Civic Education and Public Information,Leveraging Organic & Locally Grown Community Partnerships,VA,51041,Chesterfield County,"How Chesterfield, as local government, informs and engages with our community on important topics is rapidly changing. While we have witnessed success through traditional means and e-based services – community meetings, Chesterfield’s website, social platforms, e-newsletters, blogs and podcasts – we needed to identify a new approach to ensure we are truly reaching all segments of our population. Additionally, faced with a countywide, large-scale project, we knew we’d need help in the endeavor to educate and inform the public.

Strategic and purposeful engagement, through the help of key community partnerships, enabled Chesterfield to achieve direct and far-reaching results. While a specific project led the county to reexamine its standard operating procedures, we have found wide use in how to deploy this strategic communications framework in other areas of the organization, as we address challenging community topics including mental health, public safety, and budgeting. It’s also provided opportunities to involve elected leaders in community conversations.

This communications strategy has proved to be successful, particularly as the Community Facilities Bond Plan resulted in the highest approval ever with 76 percent voting “yes.” This approach has opened an opportunity for more organic community engagement as we are empowering our key community partners to have an active voice in the process when tackling complex topics. 

The exchange of information and approaches to engage with others is constantly evolving – requiring local government to adapt and deploy new strategies to meet the needs of the community. When Chesterfield began planning the educational campaign to inform residents about the upcoming bond referendum, local leaders knew it would differ from the last referendum nearly 10 years prior and decided to be intentional about best practices to inform the community on what they’d see at the ballot box. The county was requesting the issuance of $540 million in bonds to finance new capital facilities for schools, police and fire stations, parks, and libraries. During a time of softening economic conditions and rising inflationary pressures, seeking a bond referendum of this scale was a heavy lift. This task was further complicated with early voting – shifting the county’s target earlier for those hitting the ballot box 45 days ahead of election day. 

Throughout the bond referendum campaign, it became clear that the county would continue to face the engagement challenges that the bond campaign began to address. The solution provided by this engagement model can be applied to both intentional campaigns, such as the Marcus Alert rollout, and more informal meetings with the community that allow residents to raise topics that concern them.

Homesteading can save residents money on their property taxes. It also qualifies them for Minnesota’s Property Tax Refund Program. Yet many eligible homeowners don’t homestead, leaving millions of refund dollars unclaimed annually statewide. To better understand this problem, Hennepin County created a multi-departmental team to evaluate homesteading in its jurisdiction and increase participation. 

The team analyzed Hennepin County’s assessment data and identified 26,000 potentially homestead-eligible properties. This included using the Government Alliance on Race and Equity’s Racial Equity Impact Tool to uncover disparities in the homestead program. As a result of this work, they discovered that race, language, income and geography impact application rates. To maximize homestead participation, it would be essential to reach all eligible homeowners and remove barriers. 

To inform eligible homeowners and encourage them to apply, the county sent two notices with homestead benefit and application information, and held seven community events at area libraries. These efforts resulted in a 20% response rate and more than 5,800 new homesteaded properties.

To that end, HC piloted a new internship program called Green Pathways in the summer of 2022. We recruited a cohort of 4 black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) youth, who spent their summer with the department learning about various environmental careers.

The overarching goals of the program:

•	Create a supportive cohort of BIPOC youth 
•	Teach skills to add to professional resumes 
•	Inspire youth to consider environmental careers, especially at Hennepin County

The intern cohort—comprised of an Urban Scholar, who served as the interns’ day-to-day coordinator, and 3 recent high school graduates recruited through the BrookLynk program—learned to prune trees, mail environmental education literature, conduct biological monitoring, survey garbage haulers, and learned about motivating behavior change.

Two of the interns were invited to extend their internship with HC. Another intern, upon recommendation from HC, was recently hired by Hennepin County Library. Green Pathways is staying connected with past interns, providing them with networking and job postings. The program will also recruit a new cohort of BIPOC youth for summer 2023.

Eighteen community groups were hired to conduct conversations with over 500 residents, gathering their perspectives and ideas on managing waste. From these conversations, several themes were identified that the county used to form work groups to draft actions for the county’s Zero Waste Plan. Work groups comprised of community members, including many that participated in the community engagement process, and industry stakeholders, discussed and proposed 58 actions for the plan that centered around 4 core aims, one of which focused solely on improving equity in the system: create a materials management system that reduces racial disparities and advances equity. This unique approach centered the voices of those most impacted to advance equity in Hennepin County’s solid waste management system. This plan also helps the county achieve climate action goals.

It leverages Broward County Code, Section 27-175(j), which prohibits “smoking vehicles” and thus targets the transportation sector – Broward County’s main source of air pollution and emissions. Not only does this help mitigate the effects of climate change, but it also safeguards the health and well-being of Broward County’s residents and environment.
The program functions on a public reporting system to identify smoking vehicles operating on Broward County roads, with the goal of having the owners of such vehicles fix them to reduce the amount of air pollution being emitted. Once received, complaints can result in a courtesy letter or warning notice being sent to the smoking vehicle’s owner, which could eventually escalate to citations in certain cases.
In its first four months SVP 2.0 has demonstrated success through the number of smoking vehicle complaints received. As such, this program presents a novel solution that could easily be replicated by other local governments in states which do not have mandatory emissions testing but may still face issues with air pollution from transportation.

AWD-002853,2023,Information Technology,Using automated data visualization to improve responsiveness to public concerns about regulated facilities,NC,37183,Wake County,"Wake County’s Environmental Health and Safety Division (EH&S) regulates 33 facility types including restaurants, hotels, pools, and childcare centers.  With over 6,700 facilities regulated by Wake County, having a reporting system and response that is timely and consistent is important to preventing further sickness in the community.  Environmental health concerns at regulated facilities are called “complaints” and must be investigated by staff. 
Historically, it took two hours to pull data, export it to excel, and manually calculate the complaint compliance report and the division had no means to identify trends of recurring complaints at regulated facilities. On January 10, 2022, a Complaint Log Compliance Report was developed using Power Bi software that incorporates type-specific response time expectations and other key information. This real-time, automated report provides data and visualization for the current compliance response time regarding complaints received from the public.  The report is used to immediately identify complaint responsiveness and proper collection of required information. Compliance with expected response times increased from a monthly average of 95.7% in 2019-2021 to 97.9% in 2022.  EH&S leadership and stakeholders now have a visual management tool that provides real-time information to provide staff with corrective training and to monitor the pulse of the division’s responsiveness to customer complaints and consumer safety.

These residents’ voices are frequently unheard and underrepresented in planning processes and tend to be from those with diverse socio-economic backgrounds.  In response, HoCo By Design’s engagement strategy targeted not only traditional community groups and members of the public but also populations that are generally under-represented in planning - students, young adults, working parents, residents from whom English is a second language, renters and small business owners - ensuring that a diverse set of perspectives was considered in the process and the plan. The County’s Department of Planning & Zoning built relationships with diverse community leaders, lead equity-focused events, and improved communications by using more accessible and less jargon-based language.

Every hour, people throw away 2.5 million plastic bottles.  At least 14 million tons of plastic is dumped in the ocean every year and it takes an average of 500 years for a plastic bottle to biodegrade.

The Trash to Treasure Recycled Art Project was inspired by these environmental issues.  The project was designed to foster awareness and facilitate new attitudes and behaviors towards littering and recycling.  The goal of the project is to actively engage people of all ages and demonstrate ways trash can be transformed into beautiful, imaginative and captivating art. This project is a perfect example of “leveraging the arts to improve residents’ quality of life and address challenges that communities face.”

The Union County Board of County Commissioners offered a unique and innovative program to the public. A permanent, educational resource was created which can be accessed and utilized by diverse communities within Union County and beyond.  Seventeen different wildlife art sculptures were created using litter as the key component. Each art piece is a colorful and unique representation of wildlife, fabricated from hundreds of hand-painted used plastic bottles. Over 4,000 plastic water and soda bottles were reused for the project.  This educational art exhibit became multi-dimensional, as each sculpture is accompanied by an educational sign highlighting wildlife facts, key statistics about litter and recycling and how many plastic bottles were repurposed for each sculpture.

The positive outcome has been measured by its popularity and accessibility. For over two years, the project was successful in reaching over 10,000 people in diverse communities.  In addition, the project has been positively acknowledged for “success in reaching its goals,” with a state award from the New Jersey Clean Communities Council.

This results in a public demand for permits for both new wastewater systems and adjustments to current lot use and systems. Existing septic system location records extend back to the 1940s and in some cases may not be available at all. To approve accessory structure permits on lots with septic systems or permit modifications to existing systems, staff previously needed to repeatedly use a probe rod to locate subsurface components of onsite wastewater systems. Locating existing system components was time consuming, physically demanding and often inaccurate.

In April 2021, the Wake County Water Quality Division (WQ) implemented a program to decrease turn-around time for issuance of these State-mandated permits by utilizing ground penetrating radar equipment (GPR). This maximizes in-field productivity and decision-making and facilitated the reduction of turnaround time for permitting by 1.5 hours per application.  The risk of personal injury and property damage that can be caused by probing was also decreased. Staff embraced the process change.

The command unit acts as the central point of communication and decision-making, allowing emergency responders to work together more effectively. The outcomes of a command unit can be significant. By providing a centralized command and control system, emergency responders can work more efficiently and effectively, which can ultimately save lives and prevent further damage during an emergency or disaster.

While recognizing the importance of a well-developed Command Unit program and how that can greatly improve the County’s response efforts, the Office of Emergency Management (OEM) and Howard County Police Department (HCPD) started developing and implementing new programmatic practices, such as an onboarding and training program, internal procedures, processes, and policies for both Operators and Program Managers, which no previous documentation had existed. Additionally, OEM and HCPD began retrofitting outdated/non-functioning technology within the Mobile Command Posts (MCPs) and support resources. Since development and implementation of these programmatic documents, the Program has since shared these best practices with neighboring jurisdictions so they too can start bolstering their existing structures within their programs.

Trainings were typically held within the more densely populated areas of the County while only a handful were held in rural communities. Obtaining a sufficient number of volunteers from the rural communities in the County proved to be challenging as these individuals would need to commute long distances on a specific date and time to attend a training. Many potential volunteers could not attend the trainings due to prior commitments, expenses related to travel, inclement weather, or road conditions. To address and alleviate these barriers, the County moved PITC trainings to a virtual setting in 2022, allowing volunteers to attend without having to travel to a physical training site. The virtual training allowed participants to ask questions using the “Chat” feature, and periodic knowledge checks were administered to ensure an understanding of the material.

The Congressional Research Service published a memo in April 2020 discussing the typical nature for state and local governments to issue debt to finance the construction of buildings, roads, and airports. Additionally, the National Association of Counties identified within its Municipal Bonds Action Center that “municipal bonds remain the primary method used by states and local governments to finance public capital improvements and public infrastructure projects that are essential for creating jobs, sustaining economic growth and improving the quality of life for Americans in every corner of this country.” San Juan County, New Mexico has developed a long-range 30-year planning methodology that has effectively defeated the “standard practice” of financing large capital projects, instead, leveraging their capital needs with existing recurring cashflows offset by any secured federal, state, and local grant funding that may become available.

Catalytic converter thieves rarely operate within one law enforcement jurisdiction or agency. The wide spatial range of thieves makes the sharing of catalytic converter theft information between law enforcement agencies imperative. To facilitate the sharing of catalytic converter theft information between law enforcement agencies across the San Bernardino County, the Cross-Jurisdictional Catalytic Converter Theft Project was developed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology. Prior to the project, individual crime analysts kept their agencies’ theft reports in individual Excel spreadsheets and often shared with other agencies based on personal requests for information. The Cross-Jurisdictional Catalytic Converter Theft Project allows law enforcement agencies across the county to submit their theft reports to a standardized report template available via the internet. The agglomeration of reports and the data collected are then visualized via dashboards, maps, and other web applications.

Water quality has been monitored in NHC since the early 1970s by the State in efforts to study the impacts to water quality in tidal creeks from adjacent septic systems. Tidal creeks are not only used for recreation but are an important resource for the natural environment as they provide habitat for various plant and animal species. 
In addition to monthly monitoring of tidal creeks in the unincorporated county, there have been efforts from NHC to improve overall water quality including the purchasing of property with Clean Water Management Trust Funds, working with the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority (CFPUA) to test sewer infrastructure, install stormwater best manage practices, and perform additional source tracking.
Since 2007, water quality monitoring efforts within the Pages Creek watershed have documented chronically elevated levels of Enterococci bacteria. Since then, the county has funded four tracking studies to determine the origins of the bacteria, including a thermal imaging study. 
Determining the source of the contamination is necessary in order to address resident health and quality of life concerns.

In creating the PRT, MDPD took a proactive approach in providing a response capability to active shooter situations, and critical incidents in Miami-Dade County (MDC). 

The PRT provides one squad (one sergeant and eight police officers) of highly-trained personnel to every police district within unincorporated MDC, and contracted municipalities during the day shift. During the afternoon shift, PRT converts into a regional response model that provides one squad for the north-end, and one squad for the south-end of MDC. Additionally, PRT delivers services to private and charter schools, which are not provided by the Miami-Dade Schools Police Department. Each school is assigned a primary and secondary PRT officer. The assigned officers provide a direct resource liaison for the school’s administration to MDPD, and also attend monthly threat assessment meetings which are required by Florida Statute. 

The PRT model starts with training. Before being selected for the team, each officer completes a 40-hour PRT basic training course. Within the 40-hour block, PRT candidates are given instructions and tested in Mass Casualty Attack Training (MCAT), interior tactics, firearms training, casualty care, incident command, and physical skills assessments. Upon selection to the Unit, the officer undergoes an additional 80 hours of in-service training to further develop the officer in the day-to-day responses PRT officers' encounter. Furthermore, PRT developed a training model wherein one week every month, an officer from each squad, and one sergeant, are selected and attend a 40-hour block of training provided by personnel from within the PRT. This equates to 240 hours annually of training per person within the unit.",Awarded

The WHA’s financial issues arose from the discovery of severe mold damage across WHA’s properties, forcing more than 150 families to be displaced from their apartments to local hotels and other temporary housing locations until their units could be remediated. As a result, the WHA went from receiving monthly rent payments from its residents to incurring significant hotel costs and per-diem payments that resulted in cash outlays of over $1.2 million per month on top of the estimated $6.3 million to repair the units, sending the organization into a financial crisis. By May of 2022, the WHA approached insolvency and ran the risk of no longer being able to pay for the local hotels and apartments, leading to the prospect of the effected residents being evicted and having no place to live.
Upon learning of this situation, New Hanover County:
1)	Identified the Treasury’s Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP), which residents could apply for to be used as a source of funds for the hotel and temporary housing costs
2)	Sent a team of employees to the hotels and temporary housing locations to encourage the residents to apply for ERAP 
3)	Administered the ERAP funds 
4)	Originated a loan to the WHA to be used for remediation costs
5)	Offered a letter of support for the WHA to obtain a grant to be used for remediation costs
As a result of New Hanover County’s actions, the WHA has gained its financial footing and nearly 75% of the displaced families have returned home to safe and secure housing.

In the past, the Library would schedule first interviews on one day, and second/final interviews on a separate day. This scheduling process often led to second interviews being scheduled one to two weeks following the first interview, at times resulting in losing candidates to other employers. The additional time for the second interview would  also delay the filling out of paperwork, background check, and fingerprint scheduling, causing the hiring process to be slow and prolonged. Additionally, the extended interview and onboarding process deterred quality candidates who were looking to start working immediately. To remain competitive with other organizations, and move to hire within a shorter timeframe, the San Bernardino County Library implemented a new process of conducting second interviews the same day as first interviews. The new procedure resulted in the hiring process (application to onboarding) taking two to three months, whereas in the past the process could take four to six months.

Through intentional play and dialog, children improve foundational skills while caregivers learn how to easily replicate and build on the activities at home. Both children and adults develop confidence and form relationships with others in the community.

In 2018, the county had the highest number of animal complaints in Texas. In response to this issue, a stand-alone Animal Welfare Department was established in April 2020 to implement progressive animal strategies. With the creation of the new department, County leaders soon recognized that there was a shortage of services for pet owners in the community, specifically low-cost and free spay and neuter services. While El Pasoans would like to address the medical needs of their pets, they could not afford it and there were not enough veterinarians in the community. On August 19, 2020, the El Paso County Pet Wellness Clinic was established to offer low-cost and free spay and neuter services to pet owners. To ensure the success of the project and to address the lack of veterinary doctors, County leaders created a unique pathway for foreign veterinarians to be certified and licensed in the United States and work in El Paso. The pet wellness clinic has been successful in reducing the number of stray animals in the county while improving the health and safety of its residents. ",Awarded

At over thirty-five (35) years old, the system was antiquated and out of date. Its programming languages and database were past their end-of-life. Further, the County was facing retirements by staff members who supported the system and finding skilled individuals to backfill them was becoming challenging. Finally, the legacy system was expensive to maintain. A solution was necessary.  

Orange County decided to develop its own solution. The new system would either meet the legacy system as a “Like-for-Like"" model or would surpass it.  The County built a team from internal resources, previously embedded vendors, utilization of retirees, and a third-party vendor to develop the new system.  

The effort faced many challenges along the way. The project was originally planned for two years; however, it took five. The development effort became a war of attrition. In the end, the County was successful.  

Orange County moved its new automated property tax system into production in September, 2022. The new system was brought online in the middle of the Secured Tax Roll season. The system’s quality proved itself as it operated without issue.   ",Awarded

RV PROGRAM AFTER HURRICANE IAN
Population: 194,843 (2022 U.S. census estimate)
Program Year: 2023

ABSTRACT OF THE PROGRAM

Charlotte County created the RV Registration Program, which was developed due to the devastating effects of Hurricane Ian.  We worked to help our citizens secure their homes and possessions after this incredible weather event.  Charlotte County was one of the first counties in our state to begin this program. Our state has unique weather events that must be treated differently than other parts of the country.  We aimed to provide temporary housing solutions needed during these times. Charlotte County residents whose properties were severely damaged or destroyed have been allowed to bypass many of the zoning codes that were in place before the destruction caused by Hurricane Ian and move forward to rebuild. 
Recognizing the urgent need for shelter, Charlotte County implemented this program, which permits recreational vehicle, (RVs) use on affected properties for up to two years. While the county has not historically allowed this practice, creating the RV registration program demonstrates a compassionate and flexible approach to addressing the housing crisis following the storm.
This program's objectives include expediting the registration process, providing clear guidelines for RV usage, and actively tracking the two-year limit to ensure compliance. By doing so, Charlotte County has offered a lifeline to those in need while maintaining oversight and preserving the community's long-term interests. This innovative and timely solution showcases Charlotte County's commitment to supporting its residents during challenging times and serves as a model for other communities facing similar post-disaster housing challenges.

Through this, our office realized the community was not generally aware of property tax relief options. By state law, property tax relief has several requirements, limiting the program to the County’s most vulnerable taxpayers.

In 2021, we began in earnest to work to improve participation and understanding of property tax relief options. Working with our partners in Planning, Information Services and Communications, our office clearly identified the populations eligible for tax relief and analyzed the percentage of taxpayers taking advantage of these programs. We re-designed information to better educate taxpayers and partnered with community organizations to distribute information, as they are sometimes more trusted by vulnerable populations.

Community organizations readily shared our information to targeted taxpayers, municipalities included property tax relief information in their resident outreach, and elected officials explained property tax relief to grassroots organizers. As a result of these efforts, we saw an almost 10% percent increase from the prior year in struggling homeowners receiving much-needed property tax relief and 30% of all applications received were a result of the revamped information and enhanced outreach.

In order to sustain an excellent level of service (LOS), MCDOT’s Asset Management team made improvements to the process used to track the condition of these ancillary assets.  

MCDOT evaluates the condition of its non-pavement assets twice a year. Prior to the implementation of the improved process, crews would evaluate randomly chosen 0.1-mile segments of roadway, collecting data on any ancillary asset within that segment. This sample-based approach was not representative of the overall condition of the network; however, because asset types vary from segment to segment. 

In 2022, Asset Management modified the process and crews began taking samples by specific asset type. Further, the team redefined the deficiency criteria, implemented a training program for evaluators, and made the results available to view online. By using this new approach, MCDOT is now more effectively planning, budgeting, and managing its asset maintenance work.

AWD-003073,2023,Information Technology,Penalty and Interest Refunds Project,CA,06071,San Bernardino County,"The Penalty and Interest Refunds Project was developed to improve the manual process of providing taxpayer refunds due to roll corrections. The San Bernardino County Auditor-Controller/Treasurer/Tax Collector is responsible for processing the refunds of any penalties, fees, and interest due to the taxpayer. Determining these refunds required staff to manually review and process each claim individually, which was a time-consuming and error-prone process. Due to this manual process, refunds began accumulating over the years, resulting in a multi-year backlog of approximately 4,500 refunds. As a result, staff found it increasingly difficult to process such a large amount and keep up to date with daily incoming refunds. 

The Tax Collector Division (ATC-TC) teamed up with the Information Technology Division (ATC-ITD) and the Property Tax Division (ATC-PT) to develop the Penalty and Interest Refunds Project. ATC-ITD developed a solution integrated with the 40-year-old mainframe system to monitor the property tax downward corrections and automatically determine refunds eligible for penalty and interest refunds while calculating the correct amount. This innovative solution allows staff to process the penalty and interest refunds in a centralized system while effectively streamlining the business processes.

Annually, ATC-TC will analyze the fee amounts, counts, and total amounts collected versus work performances to determine if any adjustments are needed for the upcoming year to recover the administrative costs and for budgeting purposes. To complete this analysis, ATC-TC had to request a transactional data dump and manually generate reports using Microsoft Excel as the primary reporting tool. However, these manual reports do not provide clear pictures of the County's financial and fee management. Moreover, this manual process is very time-consuming and highly error-prone.  

ATC-TC collaborated with the Information Technology Division (ATC-ITD) to find a financial analysis solution that would be more efficient and accurate for studying the tax collection fees.

The program engaged 20 teens at the Aguila Library on the basics of career paths in healthcare and health sciences.

These first-generation Mexican-American teens have been growing up in an underrepresented, underserved and sparsely resourced rural community of Maricopa County. In this program, these teens learned about the needs and processes of health care, public health, pharmacy, and community health work. The program also included cardiopulmonary resuscitation training, health assessment training, and a medical class on the heart with the University of Arizona medical students. In the program, students practiced laparoscopic surgery and engaged with new healthcare technologies. They practiced their implementation in hands-on practice sessions, all directed by University of Arizona medical students and Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health employees.

Altogether, students in the Y.E.S. Camp received new knowledge and skills, and were given direct hands-on health experience, guiding them to become the next generation of health leaders. “In addition to learning about healthcare careers, students were given in-depth reasoning, a clear understanding of opportunities in healthcare as related to post-secondary education. They met with the University of Arizona academic advisors and learned about financial aid and scholarships.” University of Arizona statement.

A recent increase in the number of assigned fully funded contaminated sites due for inspection has necessitated the combining of spatial awareness, direct-to-report data collection, data validation, process streamlining, and live tracking of key performance indicators analysis tools to ensure that DERM meets contractual obligations and deliverable due dates. 

Collaboration between RER and ITD has allowed DERM to develop a phased approach utilizing a suite of solutions to integrate ESRI products such as ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Pro, Survey123, Dashboards, and Microsoft services such as Power Automate, Microsoft Office, Azure, and SharePoint.  These solutions have been essential for deployment on Microsoft Windows Operating systems, Android Operating Systems, and Apple (IOS) Operating Systems. The solutions have eliminated the need for paper-intensive workflows, reduced redundant processes, reduced devices needed to create and review reports, and minimized backlogs which in turn has allowed Inspectors, Site Managers, and Section Managers to dedicate additional time towards meeting higher levels of service. Productivity has increased by about 30% in asset inspection completion rate over the course of the year while most recent version of the solutions have increase inspection completion rate from 2.2 a day to 6 a day, and performance indicators for various stages from capture to review and submittal are available for management live where they were not available previously.

The staffing demographics were 94% white males: higher than the national average of 80%. The workforce was not representative of the County’s 43% diverse citizenry. The lack of diversity presented several challenges for the agencies to include difficulty in recruitment and retention and limited cultural competence to better serve citizens. Lack of diversity and hiring challenges are historic to careers in fire services across the nation. 
One of the largest barriers to minority entrants was the nine-month unpaid academy. Wake learned that most minorities lack support and are unable to participate in an unpaid academy. Fire Chiefs attempts to diversify their hiring yielded little to no results. All stakeholders were unified in the goal to “Make it Better.”
In collaboration with the Fire Services Director, Municipal Fire Chiefs, Wake Tech Community College (Wake Tech), Human Resources launched a successful Career in a Year campaign which included paying academy participants and focused diversity campaigns.

Staff also designed tools and resources to improve the onboarding experience, while reducing urgent requests to our operational support teams. Ongoing new hire survey feedback is monitored to evaluate and optimize the program.

AWD-003200,2023,Health,Health Equity Approach to Vector Control ,CA,06071,San Bernardino County,"​Mosquitoes are the deadliest creatures in the world, killing approximately 700,000 people annually by transmitting diseases such as malaria, West Nile, St. Louis Encephalitis, Western Equine Encephalitis, and Zika. San Bernardino County’s Mosquito and Vector Control Program (MVCP) is charged with protecting the public from mosquito-borne diseases and provides service to 11 cities and nearly all the unincorporated areas in the County. MVCP routinely checks potential mosquito breeding water sources and takes measures to prevent it. MVCP also mitigates mosquito breeding through residential service calls. These are important because it allows homeowners/tenants to provide insight to their property and neighborhood, thus giving MVCP a better perspective on how to protect the residents and their neighbors. Upon review of the residential service call data, MVCP found that majority of the requests were coming from affluent areas of the County, ones with a higher Health Places Index (HPI). The higher the HPI, the better the social conditions are that drive health (i.e., clean air, water, education, life expectancy, etc.). MVCP saw an opportunity to improve health outcomes in low HPI areas, and in April 2022, launched a Health Equity Approach to Vector Control focused in the lowest quartile of the HPI.",Awarded

This service, which is paid for as part of the department’s annual non-ad valorem waste fee, allows customers to place bulk trash items at the public right-of-way at their property and have those items collected by the department. 

Prior to January 3, 2022, bulky waste pickup service was provided upon request and collection took place anywhere from one to eight days from when the pickup was requested. However, the collection window varied for each request and customer’s bulky waste piles would sit at the curb for one to eight days waiting for service to be provided. Piles waiting at the curb that long created a number of challenges that negatively affected customers’ service.

The one-day camp was offered for rising 1st-12th graders and was established to inspire girls of all ages to see possible career opportunities in Fire & EMS.  Through multiple age-appropriate modules, girls were able to learn what fire and EMS is all about. This camp was also dedicated in the honor of late Fire & EMS Captain, Helen “Gracey” Humbert, who served within the department for over a decade.  Gracey passed away in April of 2022 after battling breast cancer. She was the essence of what a female can be in the fire service and her story and legacy were shared as part of the camp.

•	Climb over an obstacle course 
•	CPR and basic First Aid
•	Participate in a Dummy Drag Relay
•	Learn about Fire Science
•	Vehicle Extrication

The Department of Public Health has implemented a Collective Impact approach as the backbone of the San Bernardino County Community Vital Signs Initiative (Vital Signs). Vital Signs is a collective impact initiative that seeks to improve health outcomes by organizing cross-sector groups of partners to transform a system by sharing a common agenda. The Vital Signs Initiative was established by three county departments: Public Health, Behavioral Health and Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, and transformed into a community-wide health improvement initiative responsible for operationalizing the Wellness element under the San Bernardino Countywide Vision. Vital Signs prioritized the most urgent issues that impact the health and wellness of our county residents and how factors such as the economy, education, safety, and health issues affect one another. Working collectively with partners, stakeholders and the community, a series of community health assessments were conducted to collect and analyze primary and secondary data and create and implement a plan to address issues that negatively impact our community’s health outcomes. As a result of this effort, we collected over 6,400 surveys across the county, elevating the voices of the populations that traditionally go unheard to develop a comprehensive assessment and community health improvement plan.",Awarded

More importantly, Miami-Dade County continues to be challenged by development patterns that do not provide the necessary densities/intensities along existing or planned transit lines. The County has been forward-looking in promoting development initiatives that support a robust regional premium transit system that connects population and employment centers. This poses numerous challenges and considerations that have resulted in the development of various zoning and procedural tools for implementation in both the unincorporated and incorporated areas of Miami-Dade County that call for new and innovative approaches that focus on equitable implementation of policies. On September 1, 2022, the Miami-Dade County Board of County Commissioners (BCC) adopted Ordinance No. 22-106 (the “SMART Corridor Ordinance”) to assist in the implementation of recently adopted land use policies that promote transit-oriented development and redevelopment along existing and planned rapid transit corridors (SMART Plan corridors).  The SMART Corridor Ordinance works in conjunction with long-standing policies and regulating plans that promote moderate to high-density development in designated Urban Centers around rapid transit stations by also addressing the areas along transit lines between stations. The County’s SMART Plan land use policies and SMART Corridor Ordinance allow the development of vertical or horizontal mixed-use projects with up to 60 dwelling units per acre/2.0 Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and up to 36 dwelling units per acre/1.5 FAR in areas between ¼ and ½ mile of the SMART Plan corridors, regardless of the underlying land use designation.  Since the adoption of these SMART Plan land use policies in 2019, several large and small developers have taken advantage of these policies to achieve greater densities and intensities while advancing key County regional transportation objectives.

The workshops make it possible for these organizations to gain the knowledge to create workforce housing dwelling units that benefits both the community organizations and the ultimate occupants of the newly developed workforce housing dwelling units.

Since the inception of the revamped Workshop Program in 2022, there has been an increase in the participation of small to mid-sized builder/developers, an increase in workforce housing units physically constructed, and a reduction in contributions in lieu of providing the physical workforce housing units.

Because Clerk’s Offices rely on poll workers returning from previous elections to ensure consistent election delivery and retention of institutional knowledge, Clerk’s Offices need to get creative in their efforts to retain poll workers. In 2021, the Santa Fe County Clerk’s Office introduced new strategies to overcome this obstacle. 

A Presiding Judge Mentorship Program and a Post-Election Debrief was developed for our county’s temporary election workers. The mentorship program was designed to provide our new Presiding Judges the opportunity to shadow an experienced Presiding Judge during Early Voting to gain confidence about the requirements and tasks to effectively run a polling location. 

The Post-Election Debrief was created to provide the necessary feedback from our election boards on what worked well and what needed improvement. This program allowed our office to meet with our leadership and non-leadership positions to ensure well-rounded feedback on how well training, resources and support were given. The provided feedback helped our team identify areas of successes and concerns and helped hone the procedures and hands-on work that is required to run a polling location.

These programs instilled a great working relationship of mutual respect and constructive feedback between the County Clerk’s Office and temporary election staff which aides in crucial election worker retention. New and returning election workers appreciated the opportunity to participate in both programs, felt ownership of the election process by giving actionable feedback, increasing their likelihood of returning to serve in the future.",Awarded

AWD-003322,2023,Health,A Health Department's journey towards data informed programmatic delivery,UT,49035,Salt Lake County,"Public health has traditionally not had the connection to timely and granular data that can assist in program delivery.  Our program delivery is often the result of historical funding and initiatives and not based on present community needs.  Our department embarked on an initiative, with funding from the Kresge Foundation, in 2018 to move our department away from broad-based program delivery to include a more focused attention on communities with historical inequitable health outcomes using timely data to inform our program delivery.  Our department is the largest public health department in Utah and because of that serves a growing and diverse population with a growing and changing need from public health.  We began our journey before the COVID outbreak, but as was evidenced nationally, COVID highlighted even more the need for public health to have access to timely and granular data that is used to inform program delivery - where the services are provided, in what way, and at what times. What we wanted to accomplish through our initiative was to create a bureau of staff that would focus on working with programs to identify what data they create, what they use, how the data is used and is there a potential to connect to more data. Staff with these evaluation and analytical capabilities were mainly located in our Epidemiology Bureau and were more focused on disease investigation, not program data, analytics, or evaluation. The few staff that focused on program evaluation and analytics were randomly placed throughout the department and were more a product of grants that required these deliverables as part of the funding. The department had a real need to create a bureau where staff with analytics and evaluation capability could work together in a cohesive unit rather than placed in separate areas of the department so that a synergy could be created, with focus on identifying skills that the group needed to improve the services they could provide to department programs. We knew this Bureau needed to be viewed as a department resource rather than placed in a specific division tied to a specific funding source.  With staff assistance, we created this Bureau (Population Health and Informatics- PHIB) in late 2019, bringing staff together from different areas of the department, we braided funding sources so that the created team worked together rather than siloed depending on their funding and placed this new Bureau in the department's administration division.  PHIB, once created, hit the ground running and even with the interruption of the department's COVID response has led to better understanding of what data our programs create (through a data scan) what skills the team needs to become more proficient on, specific data projects for programs that programs are using to inform their program delivery.",Awarded

HIH aims to tell the story and impact of racially restrictive covenants contained in property deeds in Durham, North Carolina using public records information and archival documentation. As instruments of discrimination, racially restrictive covenants codified segregation into law, but also allowed segregation to persist once the federal government had begun making it illegal. The resulting widespread economic and social disenfranchisement has resonated across generations.  

These restrictions are still part of the property deeds in communities across the country today and we believe the practice of interrogating them as a community can inform our efforts to dismantle racism in Durham County.

More than half of past participants have returned to the community and not recidivated.

Since 2020, FCSO offers individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) Medication for Addiction Treatment (MAT) and ensures wraparound recovery supports. FCSO recognizes OUD as a chronic illness that jails are required to treat. Transformative changes include validated SUDs screening tools and withdrawal protocols, peer support, counseling, workforce training, revised standard operating procedures, harm reduction and enhanced release plans. FCSO strives to be a correctional leader in its efforts.

Reentry efforts include peer support and enhanced release supports, such as direct linkages to outpatient clinics/ residential treatment, transportation, recovery housing grants, bridge medications and NARCAN, cell phones, and backpacks with basic transitional items.

A market survey was done to see what the most desirable characteristics were, what customers might be willing to pay and what markets were possible.  HoCo Bio was registered with the state as a fertilizer, a label was created and ads placed in local farming publications.  The response has been good, with a handful of interested parties.  In 2022, trial loads were delivered to 4 potential customers which resulted in a short-term purchase agreement for HoCo Bio. The overall costs reductions have been significant.

They often lack trust and confidence in the criminal justice system.  Staff believed strongly that DCCC needed to design a space that represented and captured its clients and reflected their race and culture. 

This project brings the passion of art and culture together to make a difference for the department’s most at risk populations.  The lobbies serve as the “front door” to the department and the first interaction clients have with DCCC staff.  Redesigning these spaces was thought to have the biggest impact.  The goal of the project was to use trauma informed design and cultural awareness to create a more inviting, calming, and inclusive environment to help ease interactions and create a more positive experience for clients.
The project focused on spatial layout to create a sense of safety and calmness, visual interest to alleviate stress and promote well-being, trauma informed paint colors for a calming effect, and a durable but open furniture arrangement with safety in mind.  The project also strived to include plants in the design which have been found to reduce stress and improve mood.

The initiative is a two-fold program that has far exceeded expectations for success. Henry County Government and HCPD, through Chief Mark Amerman, have prioritized mental health in the public safety sector as police calls more frequently have a mental health crises component. 
Chief Amerman initiated two priorities within the program, with the first one being Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) for all officers. The second part of the initiative was to hire a licensed professional counselor, certified in first response, who was authorized to assess an individual and determine if an individual involved in a police call/complaint would be better suited to be remanded to a mental health facility rather that the Henry County jail. Best practices show that for those suffering with a mental episode where police are called to intervene, routinely don’t get the treatment they need by being taken to jail. Having a mental health professional on call to immediately assess the situation keeps those individuals out of the jail system and into the healthcare system in order to receive treatment.

Dengue virus (DENV), a mosquito borne disease, is not endemic in the continental United States. MCESD-VCD mosquito surveillance has identified Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in Maricopa County. MCDPH-DEI investigates suspected DENV infection in residents.
In 2017, this partnership drafted an “Aedes Arboviral Coordinated Response Protocol” to be enacted if local DENV transmission is suspected. Both human and mosquito thresholds were established, and a tiered joint response plan was developed.
On November 7, 2022, DENV-3 infection was identified in a resident; MCESD-VCD tested Aedes aegypti mosquitos trapped near the case. Mosquitoes trapped on October 5th tested positive for DENV-3, suggesting potential local transmission. As per the response plan, teams canvassed residences within the affected area to collect human specimens for DENV testing and assess properties for mosquito breeding. Teams approached 241 households; 72 (29.9%) consented to environmental assessments, and 10 (13.9%) properties had evidence of active mosquito breeding. One person had confirmed recent DENV-3 infection with no travel prior to symptom onset. Coordinated surveillance and response activities identified the first locally acquired human DENV infections in Maricopa County.

But as the pandemic became permanent, it accelerated digital transformation, which pressured Larimer County to implement communications solutions in weeks, rather than months or years. As Larimer County continued to adapt to this transformation, it was clear that the need for a unified communications platform was more important than ever before. 
As the county vacated leased spaces, embraced remote work, and increased virtual collaboration; the demand for a Unified Communications platform grew. The program started as a technology change and grew into a culture change. Larimer County deployed Zoom’s full Unified Communication platform (chat, text, meetings, webinar phone, and conference rooms) to 2,500 employees in 8 months. The results were vacated leased spaces and thus a lowered carbon footprint, taxpayer savings of over $250K per year, a “work from anywhere” culture, job vacancy reduction for Human Services of 40%, increased digital collaboration for both employees and community members and continued innovation, such as our post-go-live deployment of a virtual receptionist kiosk to help community members in the way they prefer to be helped.

The purpose of these reports was to provide the Board and the public with strategic and operational updates from each department. These reports were manually created in standalone Word documents, eventually converted to PDF documents, and were attached to the Board agenda. 

As the program evolved, the County determined that while the Board was receiving the reports, the standalone Word/PDF versions were not easily accessible or understood by the public. By leveraging its existing Performance Management (PM) System, the County was able to transition from manually created reports to reports automatically generated via data entry. 

Utilizing the PM System as a data and information repository also allowed the County to leverage existing technology licenses (Microsoft PowerBI and ArcGIS Hub) to automatically import the data into PowerBI dashboards that were then published to the Board and marketed to the public. This change enhanced monthly reporting to the Board and increased the transparency of reporting to the public, while also generating visualizations that made trends in performance data easier to identify and understand.

The final dashboards were launched publicly on October 3, 2022 and the “Monthly Management Reports and Data Dashboards” website has received over 9,500 visits to date. The County played a critical role in implementing the program and providing the necessary resources and support to make it a success. The County also played a key role in promoting the program to the public through various communication channels, including social media, press releases and Board meetings. Overall, the program represents a significant step forward in promoting transparency and accountability in the County's operations and is a testament to the County's commitment to serving the public.

A key finding in the comprehensive plan was a need to enhance convenience and accessibility; residents would like to travel a maximum of two miles to enjoy facilities and programs. A second key finding was a need to prioritize facility/amenity and program/activity investments, with the highest program need being adult wellness and youth fitness, and wellness being in the 75th percentile or higher for town hall meetings and special event data collection. Providing access to a previously permit-only amenity allowed Gwinnett Parks and Recreation to address these needs by presenting a space for self-led fitness and social opportunities for youth and adults via our multipurpose fields.

The structure was inefficient and did not meet the transportation needs or wants of the community. That inefficiency, coupled with the Covid impacts of a travel-wary public and high driver turnover, led to unreliable service at an unforgiving expense. There was a call for redesign. A study was conducted. Recommendations were made. Action was taken: in June 2021, Sarasota County launched OnDemand. 

OnDemand is a curb-to-curb rideshare (demand-response public transportation) service. Its founding principles were the elimination of low-performing fixed routes, the application of subsequent savings to a new mobility on demand service, and integration of the two services into a hybrid transportation network. Goals of the redesign included increasing ridership, enhancing the customer experience, and adding value to taxpayers. 

Nearly two years after the launch, Sarasota County plans to keep its hybrid fixed route + OnDemand mobility system. OnDemand ridership continues to grow. Customers report high satisfaction ratings. Cost per passenger has decreased. People who never used public transportation are now riding.

Program goals are to take unwanted firearms out of the community, thus reducing the potential for them to cycle through illegal networks or end up as potential hazards in the home. The idea behind gun buyback efforts is that gun violence can be lowered by reducing the number of guns in civilian hands.

However, many individuals do not take advantage of preventative screening services. Factors that reduce willingness to participate in health screenings include: (1) lack of time off/leave; (2) affordability; and (3) lack of convenience/scheduling of screening procedures is cumbersome.  COVID-19 caused significant disruptions in routine health care, where individuals stopped getting this care.  Even with medical providers resuming regular office hours, individuals have been reluctant to seek regular checkups and screenings which significantly impacts overall wellness. 

Through a new effort initiated January 1, 2022 which emphasizes a significant commitment to wellness initiatives and strategic partnerships with local organizations and insurers, Howard County Government launched and implemented several creative strategies to significantly improve wellness education, enhance access to Preventive health screenings, and reduce costs to the County and its employees.     

The County’s program addresses systemic barriers inhibiting access to Preventive health screenings. Providing workplace screening events which are assessable to the public, allows individuals to have free services, convenient access, and eliminates scheduling/traveling to multiple doctor’s offices.  It also reduces workplace absenteeism, mitigates complications from undetected/chronic illness and improves the overall health/morale of the workforce.  By instituting a change in the wellness paradigm, the County has succeeded in  promoting healthy living for employees, dependents and the community.

In 2018, the creek’s watershed experienced an unprecedented (500 year) rainstorm that scoured the stream bed, exposing a sanitary sewer line. In response, the City of Port Washington installed emergency protection of the utility corridor that created a dam with a large vertical drop (3-4 ft) from the top of the concrete to the downstream water surface during typical flow conditions. This new structure created a major barrier for fish passage <¾ mile from Lake Michigan.

AWD-003609,2023,Criminal Justice and Public Safety,Technology pushes instant warrant and courtroom manuals updates to assistant prosecutors,MI,26099,Macomb County,"The Macomb County Prosecutor’s Office used technology in a new way in what may be a first for a Michigan prosecutor to push warrant manual updates to assistant prosecuting attorney laptops.

Assistant prosecutors use a warrant manual and courtroom manual from the Prosecuting Attorneys Association of Michigan, which provides updates several times throughout the year. The manuals are provided in various downloadable formats.  It was cumbersome for approximately 70 assistant prosecutors and approximately 40 staff to download the updates for both manuals because updates were sporadically released at various times. Having a staff person download the latest manuals to a network drive was not practical because assistant prosecutors are frequently in court without county network access.

The solution applies software updating technology to the warrant manual and courtroom manual updating process to provide assistant prosecutors with automated updates of both manuals, and makes them accessible whether or not assistant prosecutors have county network or Internet access, or neither.

The Macomb County Prosecutor’s Office now accepts all major credit cards, even Apple Pay, and is believed to be the first Michigan prosecuting attorney to accept credit card payments for discovery fees. The system integrates with iPads. This service also allows supervisors, at a glance, to monitor the transactions and revenue in real-time.

In addition to the formal agreement and policy acknowledgment, an employee’s program approval is contingent upon HR receiving a submission request by their Department Head, a performance/disciplinary review with Employee Relations, and successful completion of the Telework training plan utilizing our learning management system. Implementing this initiative has successfully resulted in a better work-life balance for employees, while substantially increasing their efficiency and productivity -proving to be a mutual benefit to both employees and the County.",Awarded

AWD-003655,2023,Civic Education and Public Information,Franklin County Government Education Program,MO,29071,Franklin County,"This program makes civics part of everyday conversation in Franklin County, Missouri. Since his election in 2018, Franklin County Clerk Tim Baker has taken on the mission of educating the public about voting and county government. As one of the first counties in Missouri to take on this initiative, we created a multi-discipline template. We established a County Clerk Facebook page. @FCMOClerk, to make information readily available to citizens. The page is host to the “Civic Minute” and “History Minute” videos. Next, we created the “Let’s Learn About Know Franklin County” Activity Book, which is aimed at third and fourth graders, then contacted Franklin County elementary schools and offered to bring the book and present to their students. We visited 14 schools in 2022 and 2023 and spoke to over 1,300 students. We then retooled the activity book for adults and provided it to East Central College for distribution to their students. Learning must be entertaining; this is as true adults as it is for children. Each election, Tim sings an original song about voting with vital election information. Each part of this program utilized the unique talents of the staff in the Franklin County Clerk’s office.",Awarded
