SBC DPH continued on its mission to provide the resources necessary to build healthy, safe, and resilient communities. The new state system CalVax presented the issue of creating equitable vaccination opportunities within the 20,000 square miles of our County at the forefront of COVID-19 response. Initially, a few large hospitals were automatically enrolled in the California Vaccination Program; however, the process for onboarding new providers proved to be difficult to navigate for smaller facilities and County-facilitated sites due to their inability to store the state provided minimum orders. To overcome this challenge, PRP developed a new program under the COVID-19 response: the COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution, Allocation and Appointments Team (DAAT). DAAT ensured that COVID-19 vaccines would be accessible to all SBC healthcare providers, pharmacies, and County sites through a novel County-specific redistribution plan to maximize opportunities for vaccination and immunity throughout the county.

AWD-001799,2022,Planning,Countywide Lakefront Public Access Plan:  A Resilient & Accessible Lakefront for All,OH,39035,Cuyahoga County,"The Cuyahoga County Lakefront Public Access Plan (LPAP) seeks to expand lakefront public access while improving coastal protection along primarily privately-owned shorelines.  Historic development patterns and economic pressure has resulted in only 22% of the Cuyahoga County lakefront (13% outside of downtown Cleveland) being publicly accessible.  As concern over inequities in public lakefront access rose, Lake Erie experienced the effects of climate change.  Unprecedented high lake levels and limited winter lake ice combined to produce severe coastal erosion that threats property, buildings and infrastructure.  

The Lakefront Public Access Plan builds on the successful public-private partnership model built in Euclid, Ohio – a community at the eastern edge of Cuyahoga County.  That model and the Plan offer a framework in which private landowners voluntarily donate or provide lakefront easements to the County to construct new public lakefront access that enhances recreation in exchange for public investment in shoreline protection – something that can only be truly effective when addressed at scale versus on a parcel-by-parcel basis.  The LPAP identifies new public access along 50% of the shoreline, supports a more equitable distribution of community access, defines a continuous multimodal lakefront route connecting east-west throughout the county, and suggests a more resilient shoreline countywide.

AWD-001064,2022,Risk and Emergency Management,Fairfield County EMA Vaccination Call Center,OH,39045,Fairfield County,"After almost a year of COVID-19 infections, the first vaccines were released in December 2020. Discretion of how to schedule and administer vaccines were left to local governments, but without direction or guidelines. The Fairfield County Health Department (FCHD) attempted to schedule residents for appointments based on mandated eligibility and availability of vaccine. This quickly became difficult due to a time-consuming process with limited staff and the other responsibilities placed on the Health Department. FCHD turned to the Fairfield County Emergency Management Agency (FCEMA) for help with a solution.
FCEMA quickly put together a call center with county staff and resources in the Emergency Operations Center (EOC). Lists of residents that signed up to receive the vaccine were robocalled with a local phone number and assisted with scheduling a vaccine appointment. 
Over 19,000 residents were scheduled in eight weeks to receive the vaccine with the Health Department. By utilizing technology, programs already in place, county staff, and not costing any additional funds over standard operational costs, the success of this program was invaluable.

Most patients presenting to the DHS EDs, either on their own or referred by their providers, do not need ED care or hospital admission for paracentesis, lumbar puncture, or thoracentesis. This over-utilization of valuable ED and inpatient resources compromises patient access and timeliness of care, as well as risks denied hospital days and poor patient satisfaction. To address this need, we developed and piloted a fluid aspiration (FLASP) clinic at LACUSC to decrease this demand for urgent care. Since the success of the pilot project, where we were able to see more than a 50% decrease in patient presenting to the ED for paracentesis, we expand the FLASP clinic hours and procedures offered and plan to develop educational and procedural interventions to promote the clinic's use. We hypothesize that this project will increase clinic use and decrease ED use. We plan to conduct a mixed methods study with key informant interviews to assess patient and provider barriers and facilitators to the FLASP clinic use that will guide the intervention. We will quantitatively evaluate our primary outcome, reduction in unnecessary ED use from 30-40 patients per month to 5-7 patients per month, as well as other process measures including reduction in denied hospital days, reduction in hospital admissions, improved patient satisfaction and improved knowledge of patients regarding their disease.",Awarded

In 2020, the EDA enhanced this commitment by proactively engaging companies regarding the diverse array of suppliers in the community. New programmatic outreach gave rise to the launch of a quarterly SWaM webinar series aimed at increasing SWaM awareness and providing step-by-step guidance on the certification application process. Lastly, the Henrico EDA deepened existing relationships with external partners through sponsorships and purposeful commitments to support the initiatives of the Central Virginia African American Chamber of Commerce, Virginia Association of State College & University Purchasing Professionals (VASCUPP), and the Women’s Business Center RVA.",Awarded

Cannabis Intoxication Impaired Driving Labs are the first law enforcement-hosted training that addresses cannabis-impaired driving behavior and recognition of cannabis abuse through the use of actual impaired subjects.  This program aims to teach law enforcement about how to recognize general indicators of cannabis impairment by providing the opportunity to work with medically certified cannabis patients.  These patients volunteer their time to consume cannabis products so that officers can visually observe how individuals act when not sober.  

While officers are learning through this venue, so are those within the cannabis community.  Through this training, the consumer participants are able to better comprehend the dangers of drugged driving, build positive and mutual relationships with law enforcement, and act as educational resources for officers who are responsible for enforcing impaired driving laws.

AWD-001151,2022,Libraries,Gigabit Libraries: Improving Connectivity,CA,06037,Los Angeles County,"The Gigabit Libraries project was a large-scale collaborative partnership between LA County Library and LA County Internal Services Department (ISD) to implement network installation at all of the system’s 85 libraries to provide faster and more reliable wireless internet access to library customers. Prior to this project, many library locations had 12-year-old wireless access points and legacy wiring in the buildings, making internet connectivity limited to 20-30 megabits per second (Mbps), when most residential accounts perform at 100 MB per second. Installing new network cables and running new circuits allows the Library to connect to the California Research and Education Network (CalREN), a high-capacity network that serves a vast majority of research and education institutions in California. The project began in 2018 and was fully completed in 2021, increasing connectivity speed at all libraries up to 1 gigabit per second (Gbps).

This project has not only improved service to many customers who are negatively impacted by the digital divide and rely on the library for internet and computer access, but also laid the foundation necessary for other innovative technology projects on the horizon that will improve how the Library services its communities.

AWD-001165,2022,Transportation,Storm Drain Culvert Resiliency Program for Addressing Climate Change,MD,24031,Montgomery County,"Decades of development and urban sprawl have led to the construction of thousands of storm drain culverts throughout Maryland to convey stormwater below roadways. Failure to properly maintain these culverts can lead to their collapse, sinkholes, and the emergency closure of roadways - all of which affect public safety. Due to climate change, these culverts are exposed to larger storm events each year that stress their ability to convey stormwater during flood events. This increase in storm severity coupled with aging storm drain infrastructure created an environment in Montgomery County, Maryland where culverts and their roadways passing over them were vulnerable to large storm events. Montgomery County successfully implemented a storm drain culvert resiliency program that created an innovative rating system. This rating system enabled the County to objectively categorize hundreds of storm drain culverts based on drainage area flood potential, culvert structural condition, average daily traffic count, and mobility impact to the community. The program provided a basis for the County to more efficiently allocate capital improvement project funding to increase the resiliency of the storm drain culvert system.",Awarded

The Howard County Office of Emergency Management (OEM) is responsible for planning and mitigating for, responding to, and recovering from disasters in the County.

Emergency management requires significant behind the scenes work, coordination, and planning during non-disaster times. When disasters occur, quick decisions and thorough understanding of policies, procedures, and knowledge of agency contacts is vitally important to keeping the public safe and to the overall success of the operation.  As such, OEM leadership needed a way to prepare new staff who had not been a part of previous disaster responses, in a way that would help them succeed and be empowered to respond quickly in emergency situations without the benefit of institutional knowledge.  Subsequently, OEM leadership developed and merged the On Call Emergency Manager (OCEM) and Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Manager Training Program.

These programs allow litigants to negotiate a binding agreement outside of court, on their own time, at their own pace, and without face-to-face contact, if preferred. ODR offers a virtual negotiation space to reach resolution conveniently and efficiently, without entering a courthouse; links to state and local resources for litigants (e.g., housing resources for landlords and tenants); and the ability to electronically file necessary court documents. Participating litigants can get free online mediation services from professional mediators. ODR is safe, efficient, and cost-effective, saving litigants the time and commuting costs usually necessary to attend court hearings. Making it easier for litigants to achieve mutually acceptable agreements on improves litigant satisfaction and allows the Court to focus scarce courtroom resources on cases in which judicial intervention is unavoidable. Program development costs were funded by the Court and the Los Angeles County Department of Consumer and Business Affairs (DCBA). DCBA staff provide free mediation services for participants, along with staff from the Center for Conflict Resolution (CCR). ",Awarded

Staff are encouraged to spend at least one hour per week, and between three to four hours per month, learning and updating their knowledge, abilities and skills.  Staff are provided a monthly curated list of relevant webinars on a variety of interesting topics. Staff are not limited to just this list. They may also pursue other avenues of workplace, or intellectual interests. 

As an institution devoted to information and learning, the library believes not only in the importance of learning for professional development, but also in learning for the sake of personal growth.  Staff are supported by an institution that values and encourages regularly set aside time during the workday for this year-round, self-directed learning.  The payoff for the library is that staff are better able to keep current with new tools, software, databases and library trends, to deliver better quality customer service. 

In 2021, 62 library staff spent 2,860 hours dedicated to learning and professional development.  With thoughtful and knowledgeable curating from available resources, the cost of these webinars to the library and St. Lucie County taxpayers was zero.

Dumping generally happens on the roadside, but vacant lands are also impacted.  Code Enforcement Officers in San Bernardino County respond to these activities by conducting abatements: cleaning up and properly disposing of the dumped materials. These abatement efforts initially involved using a Microsoft Access database to create work orders and generate reports. Staff would create a work order in Access, print it, record abatements on paper while in the field, then enter the information into the database once back in the office. This process was time-consuming and error-prone and made it difficult for stakeholders to stay up-to-date.  

Starting in January of 2021, Code Enforcement streamlined this workflow using GIS technology. Now, staff create and dispatch assignments utilizing a web application, then complete those assignments and record abatements using mobile applications in the field, which updates dashboards accessible to stakeholders within minutes. Using this workflow, data are seamlessly shared from the office to the field and back, helping keep stakeholders informed with up-to-the-minute information, and enabling them to create reports at any time using the dashboards’ filtering capabilities.

The problem for homebound seniors is they have limited resources; they often cannot afford to feed their pet, or they are homebound with no family or friends to shop or help with food and healthcare for their pet companion.  Providing a meal and healthcare to their pet companion impacts the lives of seniors by eliminating the barriers they have in providing for their pet companions.

Research has shown that pets provide seniors an emotional rescue by reducing isolation, stress, fear, and anxiety.  Taking care of their pets gives seniors a sense of purpose, value, and self-esteem.  A pet gives unconditional love and support to seniors that may not have family or friends.

Quarantines and the reduction in services related to the COVID pandemic have amplified the problem, creating an environment in which small businesses, non-profits, and churches have often been victims of this particular crime at a time when their financial resources are already strained. The dollar value associated with this crime can be extremely detrimental to these types of organizations, and the lack of evidence and suspect information has made it difficult for police to thwart the criminals. The Henrico County Police Division created an innovative, low-cost, multi-faceted initiative in response to these challenges. This initiative has improved data collection and problem analysis, increased awareness of the crime trend, educated business owners, helped prevent thefts, and provided a mechanism to better identify stolen converters and the thieves responsible for these crimes",Awarded

In addition, the Project beautified an aging facility and added several recreational amenities to better serve the needs of the community and its residents. 

Previously, the Earvin “Magic” Johnson Park (Park) used 100% potable water for landscape irrigation and filling the existing Park lakes. To minimize potable water use, the Park was re-engineered through collaboration with project stakeholders to provide a sustainable new water source, using a unique stormwater management system to recycle runoff from the watershed. This system captures urban runoff, treats the captured flows, and then stores the treated runoff within the existing lakes where it can ultimately be reused for irrigation at the Park. It is estimated that most of the Park’s irrigation demand can be met by the storm drain diversion flows. This stormwater management system also protects the nearby Compton Creek, which links to the Pacific Ocean, from bacteria and excess pollutants that are present in urban runoff.

The County based program is the first of its kind in New Jersey.  Union County Fresh Start is a central entry point to a continuum of transformational services, which connects individuals in need with critical mainstream resources to help put them on the path to self-sufficiency. The mobile shower, laundry and restroom facility is paired with community resource providers to offer full wrap around services for persons in need. Through partnerships and outreach efforts, individuals will have the ability to access emergency shelter, clothing, case management services like housing assistance and linkages, mental health services, and job assistance. 

The program’s vision is to provide access to clean showers, laundry services and bathroom facilities to individuals facing homelessness throughout Union County with a mobile trailer that will meet the needs of clients where they are located. Proper hygiene and access to amenities that facilitate good hygiene are a basic necessity.  Many individuals can go days, weeks, and even months without a shower or clean clothing, because they do not have access to basic hygiene supplies like soap or running hot water.  Providing access to shower and laundry facilities to vulnerable Union County residents can and will transform the lives of individuals through dignity and compassion. These services can then enhance their opportunity to secure opportunities such as employment and housing; further ensuring a path to self-sufficiency.

Due to the long and varied schedules of hospital staff and other essential workers, the Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk (RR/CC) recognized that they have greater challenges to getting out to vote in-person or by mail. Mobile Vote Centers then became a cornerstone of the RR/CC’s ability to continue providing safe in-person voting in response to an emergency. The RR/CC’s Mobile Voting Program focused much of its recruitment efforts on locations like hospitals and medical facilities to fulfill the voting needs of essential workers who worked tirelessly during the pandemic.
The RR/CC partnered with medical facilities such as: Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital, Olive View Medical Center, LAC + USC Medical Center, and six Providence Medical Centers. The RR/CC provided one - two full days of voting services at each facility. Hundreds of medical professionals, often in their scrubs or white coats, were able to cast their ballot - taking away the stress of figuring out where or when they would be able to cast their ballot.

These changes required the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk (RR/CC) to re-tool their process for delivering and setting up election equipment and supplies at vote centers; hence implementing a new Vote Center Deployment and Pre-Check Process in November 2020, and further refining it during the September 2021 Recall Election. To ensure successful delivery and set up of election equipment, the RR/CC partnered with a transportation vendor who possessed the skillset and capacity necessary to achieve this complex task within a limited number of days. Additionally, Election Workers and Field Support Technicians played a critical role by conducting a Vote Center Pre-Check Process to ensure all equipment was set up and functional, and to account for all election supplies prior to the first day of voting.

COVID-19 distancing guidelines limited the capacity of each in-person training session, making it extremely difficult to train the full number of needed Election Workers using traditional in-person training.
To address this challenge, the RR/CC developed an optional virtual training program to supplement in-person training. By covering some of the important material virtually, it allowed for shorter in-person training sessions, which in turn left more time to schedule additional sessions at each location.
Election Workers quickly embraced the new option of attending virtual training and participated even though it was not a requirement. The RR/CC offered 8 initial optional training sessions and saw over 6,700 workers attend. After the success of the initial implementation, virtual training was added as a regular part of the overall training plan for elections going forward and has been used to replace in-person training for some special elections.",Awarded

Research shows that litter attracts litter – therefore litter cleanups are an effective way to prevent future littering. Citizens often seek volunteer opportunities to clean up and beautify their community. The Litter League was created to help individuals, families, organizations, and businesses perform cleanups in their local areas. Litter League kits provide groups everything needed to perform a cleanup, including a 5-gallon bucket, litter grabbers, safety vests, gloves, and trash bags. Each kit comes with a resource binder with suggestions for learning materials to enhance the cleanup project, as well as a “how-to” guide for organizing cleanups. Litter League kits are available for weekly check outs at the Williamsburg Regional Library. Citizens can also form a Litter League Team to adopt a kit for an ongoing commitment. Teams are encouraged to use their kit monthly, and as long as they are continuously reporting their cleanup details, they will be resupplied as necessary.

AWD-001282,2022,Health,Telemedicine for Alternate Destination Program (TAD),CA,06037,Los Angeles County,"Historically, patients with mental health emergencies would be transported by emergency medical services (EMS) to the nearest emergency department (ED).  Scope of practice regulation often dictates that the ED is the only allowable destination for paramedics and EMTs.  Unfortunately, many ED’s are ill-equipped to manage mental health crises and, during the pandemic, the EDs were saturated with other patients.  The result was that ambulances were held for extended periods of time due to mental health patients’ resource needs; the patients often did not get the care that they needed, and they cycled repeatedly through the system.  The Telemedicine for Alternate Destination Program (TAD) program enabled Fire Department paramedics and EMTs to connect with a nurse practitioner or physician via telemedicine, and if they met triage criteria, the patients could be transported directly to a psychiatric urgent care center (PUCC) instead of an ED.  These centers are specifically resourced for patients with mental health crises, so ambulance patient offload time (APOT) was reduced by 60 percent, critical ED capacity was maintained, and the patients got better wraparound care because the PUCCs are better equipped to arrange proper follow-up.

At its peak, nearly half of hospitalized patients, and nearly all ICU patients at LA County safety net hospitals had COVID. These hospitals and their emergency rooms were threatened with being overrun by COVID patients. In anticipation of this crisis, LAC+USC Medical Center led development of the Safer at Home Oxygen Program, through which patients with Covid pneumonia receive oxygen support in the comfort and safety of their own homes, rather than in the hospital. The program became an Expected Practice for the County of Los Angeles Department of Health Services (LA County DHS), which earned national recognition for safety, effectiveness, and patient-centeredness. The program has now cared for more 3,000 patients at home. Less than 1 in 10 of these patients returned to the hospital for inpatient care; 0 patients died at home or in transit back to emergency room.

What started as a small scale initiative, receiving an average of 20 to 30 OTC test kit (2 tests/per kit) requests per day from partner requests, quickly transformed into a larger scale operation that doubled in demand to an average of 50-80 requests per day. The need for rapid testing reached a high when a testing surge emerged in late December 2021 through January 2022, due to an increase in Covid-19 outbreaks as a result from the Omicron variant. Through the dissemination of emails, flyers, word-of-mouth, direct outreach by Cities to their eligible stakeholders, and communication from the County’s Board of Supervisor to their constituents, many partners received information on how to request OTC antigen test kits from the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health (SBCDPH). The testing team was able to provide OTC antigen test kit resources to government agencies, healthcare providers, community-based organizations/churches/non-profits, skilled nursing facilities and private schools.

Keeping in mind the need to provide equitable resources to the community, the OTC Partnership program, extended its services by taking part in direct community partnership outreach via phone calls and emails. This initiative allowed for the OTC test kit distribution to cover an extensive base of partners that may have not received information about OTC Partnership Program or had access to OTC test kits.

It is critical that individuals have all available treatment options at their disposal for successful recovery. Medications for Addiction Treatment (MAT), in conjunction with behavioral therapy and recovery supports, is an evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorders (OUD) and has been proven effective in promoting recovery and reducing the risk of overdose. To address lack of knowledge around MAT among the public and those receiving SUD treatment, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health’s Division of Substance Abuse Prevention and Control (DPH-SAPC) developed a patient awareness and educational campaign called MAT Works. The campaign’s primary goal was to encourage and empower individuals to ask their provider about MAT as a treatment option. Intended outcomes were to 1) increase coordination and referrals to SUD prevention and treatment services within high opioid-related morbidity areas; 2) increase linkages to MAT; and 3) decrease SUD and opioid associated ED visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in LAC. Based on pre- and post-survey results among SUD counselors, post-survey reported increased agreement about the effectiveness of MAT on improving clinical outcomes compared to the pre-survey.

The Federal Retail Pharmacy Partnership (FRPP) for Long-Term Care offered a logistically efficient approach to distributing vaccines to SNFs but limited the available opportunities for staff and residents to get vaccinated. LAC DPH developed a parallel local distribution system that built long-term capacity within each SNF for storing, handling, and administering COVID-19 vaccines. LAC was only one of 2 public health jurisdictions (West Virginia was the other) to directly distribute these vaccines to SNFs in this manner. By empowering SNFs to tailor their own vaccination program, they were able to overcome the anticipated logistics of the FRPP vaccine administration program. A similar effort was utilized in the rollout of COVID-19 booster doses in the middle to late 2021, also resulting in a higher vaccine uptake rate in SNF residents as compared to national rates. As of September 1, 2021 (First season post-rollout), the vaccination rate was 87% and 88%, respectively, resulting in an approximate 80% drop in the SNF resident death rate between the 2020-2021 winter surges.",Awarded

Prior to this date, County residents were permitted to maintain agreements with private haulers. The premise of the program is that residents who are invested in a trash service, are more likely to dispose of household waste in a legal manner. Consequently the frequency of illegal dumping will decrease. The solid waste program began as a pilot program in the Camelot II subdivision in 2015 and, after significant results were observed in Camelot II, the County expanded the program to four other subdivisions. Candlewood, Glen North, Glen South, Crownwood were added to the program due to their history of being hotspots for illegal dumping.

We used a hub-and-spoke model, empowering 11 organizations – including ethnic chambers, our Women’s Business Center, and a local university – to assist over 800 businesses with over 2,500 employees. EICAP brought millions of dollars of additional federal assistance to the businesses that needed it most.

EICAP also became an opportunity for us to improve how we engage our communities facing lower economic opportunity. Despite making over $375,000 in grants and coordinating with numerous organizations, we executed this program with only 0.5 Full Time Employees. Instead of increasing internal capacity, we focused on increasing the capacity of our grassroots community-based organizations. This created a partnership where we learned and worked with these organizations toward a common goal.

The existing event-permitting process was burdensome. It required applicants to email, fax or drop off permit applications. There was no public-facing website for permit submissions, nor was there an electronic mechanism for invoicing or collecting fees.

HCPD realized this need provided an opportunity to better partner with the community and improve the engagement of employees who process permits. In response, it designed an innovative digital system to transform county permitting. The objectives were broad in scope:

•	Create a public-facing online permit portal
•	Enable online permit submissions
•	Provide multiple fee-payment options
•	Deliver online permit status and approval emails
•	Enable interdepartmental event notifications
•	Provide a public search feature to identify events by locality

This project helped the library strengthen and build community through collaboration and partnerships with the Hmong citizens and other organizing institutions. It provided a platform for the library to deliver high-quality, lifelong learning opportunities that support growth for diverse community populations. It demonstrated respect for the Hmong culture and promoted awareness and understanding through the collected items and cultural programs. The Historical Association was able to increase the authentic representation of a previously underrepresented segment of our population and able to better document Hmong migration for use in future exhibitions and programming.

To help flatten the curve and stop the spread of infection, County government formed Strategic Unified Response to Guideline Education (SURGE) Outreach Teams made up of community volunteers and County employees. SURGE Teams were tasked with visiting residents and business owners in hotspot and vulnerable population areas throughout the County to provide information of the importance of maintaining social distancing, handwashing and wearing masks. The Teams also handed out kits with sanitizer and masks. Miami-Dade County is the most populated county in the state with a population of 2,700,000 and the third largest in area with 1,946 square miles, a strategy had to be implemented to identify the vulnerable areas to visit and plan how to make the best and most efficient use of the SURGE Teams. A series of processes were developed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to identify the areas to visit, create walkable routes, interactively assign routes to SURGE Teams and track progress. When the program ended in January 2021, eight million residences and businesses had been visited by the SURGE Teams, a huge undertaking.",Awarded

The failure to engage fathers often increases the length of stay for children in foster care. 

In 2016, Wake County Health & Human Services Child Welfare Division developed the “Father Engagement Service” model to provide culturally relevant father-friendly services that increase: reunification rates between fathers and their children; self-sufficiency among fathers, and engagement of fathers in the lives of their children. Through this model fathers have access to 1:1 coaching, a support group, a referral line, and community education and training.
 
To ensure sustainability and success, this work is guided by the “Wake County Father Engagement Steering Committee.” This group meets monthly to assess the needs of fathers in Wake County and to develop resources and supports to address barriers to services. Since the inception of the Father Engagement Service model, the Division has seen increases in reunification rates, fathers engaging in services, grant revenue for the county, and increased community partnerships.

AWD-001415,2022,County Administration and Management,Online Mineral Processing Tool for Air Quality Permitting,NV,32003,Clark County,"Air quality permitting for mineral processing operations requires an evaluation of the potential to emit regulated air pollutants to the atmosphere. Air pollutants are emitted from a multitude of equipment and activities. Given the unique configuration of each processing plant and varying numerical factors used to calculate potential air emissions, maintaining accurate and consistent methodologies across all permitted operators creates significant challenges for a regulatory agency. Additionally, the complex nature of emissions calculations for mineral processing operations often results in confusion and errors on the part of permit applicants.  Conventional practices include preparing applications based on overly simplified calculations, which can misrepresent potential emissions, or highly tailored calculations, which can conflict with the county's standard practices and result in inconsistent treatment across its customers. The development of an online application tool that incorporates acceptable methodologies and provides a platform to select from dropdown menus and perform calculations automatically has proven useful to everyone involved.

Information derived from wastewater-based epidemiology has proven critical to proactively determining Orange County's overall public health response to the COVID- 19 pandemic.

People who contract the virus shed genetic copies — non-viable pieces of the virus — in their waste for an average of 21 days after initial infection. Orange County Utilities collects wastewater samples from each of its three regional water reclamation facilities and analyzes the results to understand better the virus's circulation in specific regions of the county. By that measure, Utilities can advise county leadership on which areas need additional resources, including vaccination and testing sites. The data also serves as an early indicator for local hospitals on possible patient increases. Using this data to strategize resources has been incredibly helpful in the county's mission to aid its citizens while allocating critical — often scarce — supplies.

Residents and officials documented the landscape using still and aerial photography. Local groups discussed their needs for years before shovels broke ground. The famed Olmsted Brothers Landscaping Architects firm did extensive mapping and illustrations for the proposed parks. As the park system grew, neighborhoods and new development took advantage of the recreational opportunities and open space these new parks provided. All of these stages, events, and documents are captured in photographs stored in the Union County Archives, hidden to most people. 
Union County sought to commemorate the Centennial of Union County Parks in 2021, by displaying images from the Archives, with the goal of celebrating the Parks while informing and educating county residents about the work done creating our parks. The pandemic and COVID Social Distancing requirements dictated that public events and indoor exhibits be canceled. 
Then we recalled a phrase from our parks history: “As long as those in charge of the parks continue to recognize that each generation finds its own way and makes its own rules, the land can only become more important than ever.”
Using the concept of standing in history, we created a portable, a Pop-Up Photo Exhibit, commemorating “100 Years of Union County Parks,” a series photographs capturing the history of the parks over 100 years. The exhibit was created and installed in the Parks, allowing the images and information to be highly accessible while retaining pandemic safety guidelines.

CTH CA runs east-west through the Village of Greenville and Township of Grand Chute, is the primary connection between the Appleton International Airport and Interstate (IH) 41, and is designated on the National Highway System as an Intermodal Connector route. When originally constructed in 1967 as a divided rural roadway, there was little commercial or residential development along the highway, and it functioned well for many years. 

Then, in 1984 construction of the Fox River Mall catalyzed major commercial development in the area.  Development surged west of IH 41 and north and south of CTH CA resulting in a significant increase in traffic, both vehicular and multimodal.  The increased traffic and turning movements at key intersections contributed to operational issues and a measurable reduction in safety.  

In 2020, the County and its partners took action by establishing a program that led to the complete reconstruction of CTH CA.  Outcomes were immense and positive – making previous concerns a thing of the past.  The program upgraded regional connectivity, reduced traffic congestion, improved intersection safety, embraced non-vehicular traffic, and allowed the highway to again complement surrounding development patterns.

The Remote Video Visitation initiative is allowing countless individuals that are home bound, immune compromised, and from other parts of the country or the world unobstructed access to visit our inmate population. Remote visitation shows a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion since it breaks down barriers for individuals to freely and easily visit with incarcerated loved ones.

In Brunswick County, North Carolina, 2021 began with a call to action. For Brunswick County Health Services, it was time to roll up those sleeves and get to work. For eligible residents, it was time to roll up those sleeves and get vaccinated. The Covid-19 Vaccine Initiative launched and managed the extraordinary undertaking of administering Covid-19 vaccinations. With a year-round population of approximately 145,000 residents, safe and efficient vaccine strategies were imperative to accommodate the demand of the vaccine campaign. 

Together with NCDHHS, Brunswick County Health Services implemented a response plan for mass vaccinations. This was a well-coordinated strategic effort with our county and community partners, including new partnerships with the NAACP, community churches, town municipalities, and local leaders.

Vaccine operations were highly versatile, targeting pop-up clinics to reach marginalized populations and adapting to new demands as each group became eligible. We conducted drive-through pop-up clinics, operated a mass vaccination site, and provided homebound vaccinations to those in need. 

The vaccine campaign had a twofold outcome. Mass vaccinations provided individual protection and a lessened likelihood of transmission. From December 2020 through February 2021, Brunswick County Health Services has administered over 41,000 vaccinations.

The County Technology Office, paid for these interfaces to be built to private systems, something that government agencies normally do not do. 

As a result, over 50,000 multi-page reports formerly printed, collated, and delivered by County CWS workers to the DLS, CLS, and CASA organizations, are no longer manually handled. The JELS system identifies the entitled agency and once uploaded by CWS, auto-delivers the required reports to the recipient systems – eliminating all the previous manually work both by CWS and by those agencies.

For a one-time cost of $25,000, this program saves the County about $75,000/annually in labor costs and $125-150k/annually in paper.. More importantly, it provides those agencies with enhanced functionality as described by Matt Olsen, Director of Voices for Children:

The children’s librarian focused on the needs of one of the community’s greatest assets, underserved youth facing challenges in accessing library programs and services developed to enhance their cultural, educational, and recreational enlightenment.  Staff identified challenges that were hindering residents from attending programs at the North Central Branch Library.  These challenges included library staff’s inability to effectively communicate with some of the youths’ parents due to language barriers, the parents’ inability to bring their children to the library at the times programs were scheduled at the library branch, and the parents’ inability to bring their children to the library in general due to work obligations.  This prompted the children’s librarian to continue to offer innovative programming at the library branch in the areas of reading, writing, math, culinary arts, community helpers, and STEAM related subjects while also bringing these same programs to local preschools, elementaries, and middle schools for the betterment of the youth residing in the community.

A tiny, remote mountain community known worldwide as Jackson Hole, Teton County, Wyoming is famous for its stunning scenery, national parks, wildlife, and for providing memorable experiences to millions of tourists annually. But since the beginning of March 2020, the Teton County Health Department and other local agency partners have tirelessly responded to the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in a healthy community, a robust economy, and inspiring stories of cooperation, compassion, and commitment to one another. The COVID-19 Response in Teton County, led by the Teton County Health Department, focused on six areas to build and improve a sustainable response in our tight-knit community. The six areas include isolate and trace, testing and triage, vaccination, public information, business liaison, statistics, and epidemiology. Early in the response, Teton County Health Department (TCHD) quickly recognized that no matter how many staff were hired and trained, there would still be more work to do. Community networks, agency partnerships, and volunteers aided tremendously when TCHD needed support for its COVID-19 response. With so many community members and local businesses asking how they could help, the Teton County Health Department embraced volunteers to further strengthen the community’s COVID-19 response.",Awarded

The campaign achieved much success and was the first of its kind in the region. It had a profound impact on Chesterfield because it put into perspective the pulse of mental health for local children and parents and allowed YCB members to become mental health advocates for their fellow peers and give the county and region a platform to talk about it.

Supporting this philosophy, the Chesterfield County Department of Utilities began to identify and develop an inventory of its internal processes, connecting current processes with goals of customer satisfaction for internal and external customers.

In 1998, discussions began to find a solution where customers can come to one place to initiate the process of building a new house and connecting to county services. The Community Development division of Chesterfield County includes the following departments: Building Inspection, Community Enhancement, Environmental Engineering, Planning, Transportation, and Utilities. In 2016, the Community Development division team selected an enterprise land management (ELM) software called ACCELA. The idea of customers going to one place on the county’s website to apply for building permits, plumbing permits, connecting to county water and sewer, and applying for companion irrigation meters became a reality on February 16, 2021, when the Community Development division launched the ELM portal.

This five-year project required input from each department within the Community Development division. ELM consolidates zoning, plan review, utility connections for water and sewer, code enforcement, permitting and inspections into one single platform for customers. Since March 2016, our challenge has been to enhance and upgrade the level of service we provide customers through advanced technology, system flexibility, and work efficiencies. The Community Development division believed with ELM, the main objective in enhancing customer service experience would be beneficial to Chesterfield County.

The objective to improve and enhance customer service in the ELM portal included:
1) Providing better customer interaction through multiple communication channels where customers can go into the Chesterfield County website and process the necessary application for construction work.
2) Improving county business processes and service operations by requiring the customer to complete one application, in one place.
3) Improving customer service metrics where customers complete their own application at their convenience.
4) Ability to pay water and sewer connection fee less than $10,000 online with Echeck or credit card.
By applying these innovative customer service initiatives, the Utilities department provided significant improvement in customer service options, processes, and results.

With a population of just greater than 360,000, Chesterfield is the fourth most populous county in Virginia (with Fairfax, Prince William and Loudon counties exceeding it). Due to its size, CCU must field numerous calls concerning billing, start-up/closing of services, reporting of issues (such as water or sewer line breaks and/or loss of service), and regarding technical matters such as water quality. The variety of different calls demand different sections within CCU to be able to properly address concerns. Depending on the call, there may be a need for an afterhours response (e.g., water main break), or there may be a call that can only be properly addressed during day hours with full staffing (e.g., water bill discrepancy).

For CCU, the years of 2020 and 2021 have been an adjustment period. For the Operation and Maintenance division, the workplace conditions changed most significantly for the call-center staff. They went from being in the office and greeting walk-in customers five days a week to a combination of in-person and remote working. All the call-center’s staff within the Operation and Maintenance division have the ability to telework. To meet the needs of our customers, there is always one person at the front counter. The staff delivers consistent, excellent customer service by applying the best practices and learning habits that have been emphasized in our workplace culture. As challenging as it might be for everyone, this new work environment has become part of our current culture, giving us the confidence to know we can meet future challenges.

The objectives of the program included modifying the existing emergency call-center system, enhancing the customer experience, reduction of redundant systems, utilizing existing technology as much as practical, maximizing use of existing staff resources through innovative approaches to business, and reducing unnecessary customer call transfers.

The Kinship Therapeutic Foster Care Program, started in 2020 in partnership with Boys and Girls Homes of NC. The goal of this program is to license kinship families for youth in foster care who have therapeutic needs.  By becoming licensed therapeutic foster parents, the family received extra behavioral support, clinical guidance, and financial assistance to best meet the needs of the youth in their home. All youth in this program have therapeutic needs, higher than what “family foster care” can provide to them.

Therapeutic Kinship Foster care is an out-of-home arrangement for full-time care by relatives such as grandparents or uncles and aunts, godparents, or others who are not a child’s parent but have a family relationship with the child.  When a child is removed from home due to a safety concern, such as child maltreatment, these caregivers must have the necessary training to be considered a therapeutic foster home. The program, in partnership with the Boys and Girls homes, assisted families with obtaining the needed training to be categorized as a therapeutic kinship foster care placement.

AWD-001563,2022,Community and Economic Development,Gap Workforce Rental Assistance Program,NC,37129,New Hanover County,"Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, over half of renters in New Hanover County were housing cost burdened, meaning they were spending more than 30% of their income on housing costs, including utilities, insurance, and taxes. Most affordable housing programs focus on serving households making 60% or lower of Area Median Income (AMI), leaving middle-income workers with increased housing insecurity. New Hanover County designed the Workforce Housing Gap Rental Assistance Pilot Program (GapRAPP) to alleviate some of the increased housing insecurity for households who experienced financial hardship to the pandemic. The program consists of a monthly subsidy of $200 per month for single person households and $300 for multiple person households, for a one-year term.

This program aids renters by providing them with much needed assistance that frees up resources for other necessary life expenses. The impact of this assistance on individuals, families, and greater New Hanover County is both qualitative and quantitative in nature.

The SIM is a visual conceptual planning tool that represents different stages where individuals with mental illnesses can be diverted out of the justice system and into treatment.  The purpose of the project was to inform and improve cross-system collaborations and reduce justice involvement of individuals with mental illness and co-occurring behavioral health conditions.  This project was championed by Maricopa County’s Mental Health Steering Committee, whose mission is to improve the justice system’s response to those individuals by promoting community services as appropriate alternatives.

The outcomes of this project include 300+ identified pain points, 84 opportunities, and 8 high-impact solutions, 2 of which are currently in implementation.  Opportunities include methods to improve communication and collaboration among stakeholders, increase access to services, and to make a more trauma-informed experience for individuals with mental illness moving through the justice system.  Solutions in implementation are 1) a new Mental Health Unit to coordinate communication and help individuals navigate the justice system, and 2) creation of a Mental Health Court Model to bring multiple courts together with data sharing.

However, in March 2020, this grinded to a halt. It was unsafe to host groups as departments were managing crises and did not have time to sit in a classroom. Additionally, Maricopa County is one of the largest counties in the country, in population and geographically, creating accessibility challenges for in-person trainings.  The Innovation Studio saw a need to improve the level of training for employees by making innovation tools and concepts accessible to any employee in Maricopa County, providing tools and skills that individuals could immediately use, and creating a safe space where departments could collaborate with others. 

The Innovation Studio converted all training content to online, tool-based modules, teaching things that someone could learn and then immediately apply to their work. The Innovation Studio also created the bimonthly Innovation Café, where anyone from Maricopa County is invited to come and listen to guest speakers and internal county team members share tools, successes, and challenges. As of 3/21/2022, the Innovation Studio has trained 258 people and 80% of customers felt they received tools and training they can apply to their work.

The Maryland State Fairgrounds Cow Palace was one of the largest and most successful mass vaccination sites in Maryland, not only for the thousands of residents vaccinated daily but the incredibly short time spent inside (often 30 minutes or less) compared to virtually every other site in the State.  It became readily apparent early in the operation that a significant number of residents with physical and developmental challenges would be utilizing this mass site.  In order to meet the needs of all Baltimore County residents, the mass vax planning team requested and received the guidance from the Baltimore County Commission on Disabilities, a group comprised of community members and government officials.  By listening directly to community members with disabilities, the mass vax planning team was able to implement services and mechanisms to ensure that all visitors to Baltimore County’s mass vaccination sites had equal access to vaccine with few to no obstacles.

AWD-001569,2022,Health,"NATIONAL ASSOCIATION of COUNTIES AWARDS SUBMISSION FOR COVID-19 MOBILE OPERATIONS OUTREACH VEHICLE (MOOV) IN BALTIMORE COUNTY, MD",MD,24005,Baltimore County,"To increase vaccination rates in areas that were under-vaccinated, Baltimore County’s data team mapped out “hot spots” in the County.  These hot spots analyzed down to the street level, and “buildings of opportunity,” such as churches, shopping malls, community and recreation centers and local schools identified as potential sites. The majority of these locations were not suitable for a larger, mass-vax site, however they could accommodate a small mobile strike team.  The County created a strike team and designed a custom truck dubbed “The MOOV”, or Mobile Operations Outreach Vehicle.

While mobile units, per se, are not novel concepts in the field of public health, the mechanism by which the Mobile Teams deployed allowed for greater numbers to be vaccinated in a shorter timeframe.  Mobile teams that operate out of recreational vehicles or buses can typically only see a small number of patients at any given time. Due to the time required for proper registration and screening, and the mandatory observational period following vaccination, an operation performed inside a vehicle would limit vaccination number significantly.  Instead, the strike teams were modeled after common practices used in the entertainment industry, such as live music.  All necessary materials, supplies, equipment and even a majority of the furniture, were rapidly loaded into the site rolling “work-box” style road cases that allowed for an expeditiously coordinated mobilization and strike.

A small strike-team of staff quickly established a vaccination site in the hot spots and vaccinated up to 300 people over three hours with a skeletal crew dubbed “Noah’s Ark,” --two of each role: two vaccinators, two registrars, two vaccine fillers, two observation assistants, two ushers and the two logisticians who handled mobilization. (A physician was added to help patients who had medical questions or other reasons for their hesitancy)  The unit’s folding canopy allowed the unit to set up operations in a parking lot or sidewalk when a building could not provide sufficient space inside.  It is anticipated that this unit will be utilized to provide vaccines, testing and other public health services to hard-to-reach demographics well beyond the COVID-19 response.

According to authorities, the emergency alert system didn’t reach most residents. Alerts went out to the landline numbers in their database that had been enrolled when their system was created years before. Many didn’t get the alerts because the phone lines were burned by the fire. But the bigger reason was that most people no longer used landlines.  

This problem is not unique. Many emergency alert systems, which are intended to save lives, are outmoded.  Their databases consist largely of legacy landline phone numbers going to places like government buildings, large employers, and call centers. Some go to fax machines or computer terminals. This disaster was a wake-up call for the Denver suburb. But not for Travis County, Texas.

While widely acknowledged as central to quality of life, internal decision making on how to use resources has often relied on past practices and assumptions.  To make more data-driven decisions, use resources in the most efficient way possible, and have timely feedback on what products and services are most valuable to the public, CCPL used internal resources to build a performance dashboarding system delivering timely and accurate branch performance data and analysis.  This system replaces an outdated performance assessment system which did not allow for objective, measurable, and iterative progress towards individual or system goals, helping to rebuild metrics towards pre-pandemic levels.  As a result of this system, customer opinion has risen, and branch volume has built back up quickly after pandemic-related closures.  As of December 2021, physical circulation at CCPL is at 80% of pre-pandemic levels, and door count is at 60%, an impressive achievement given the headwinds facing public libraries today. ",Awarded

The program also provided housing during COVID-19 and exemplified the flexibility that often accompanies local government funded programs in response to community challenges.  The program is a component of the larger Re-Entry Services program which provides prison in-reach, comprehensive case management, validated risk/needs assessments, vocational and educational supports for employment, and connection to numerous community-based service agencies.  The housing program has a network of transitional houses and provides three full months of rental assistance followed by several months of assistance supplementing the client’s rental contribution.

AWD-001604,2022,Health,Online Reporting of Septic System Malfunctions Improves Customer Response,NC,37183,Wake County,"In June 2021, the Wake County Water Quality Division (WQ) implemented an online form for the public to report septic system malfunctions, facilitating a 50% reduction in staff response time.  Prior to this process improvement, reporting malfunctioning septic systems required that residents call the Customer Support Center (CSC) to report an issue. This initiated a multi-day, multi-division response requiring additional steps from customers and manual completion of an application that included right-of-entry authorization. The online form allows residents to submit septic complaints and repair requests 24 hours a day and includes digital authorization allowing WQ to access and investigate the septic issue.  Once information is received, the request is directly entered into the county permitting system to notify technical staff to call or visit the site.  This process reduced site visit response time from an average of 4 days between FY19 to FY21 to 2 days in FY22.  Wake County can now provide this State-mandated service more efficiently.

How can they be assured the Security program is spending its resources in a manner that will reduce the most risk per dollar spent, rather through the purchase of new tools, creation or enhancement of processes, or remediating risk with current processes and tooling?

It is against that backdrop that Oakland County undertook a journey to define a set of processes and tools to help create a repeatable, defensible methodology to ensure an efficient allocation of tax dollars across the multitude of people, processes and technology needed to defend against attacks in today’s shifting threat landscape, and to do so in a defensible, cost effective manner

Not only were Cape May County’s government services and schools disrupted but the economic well-being of the County was at stake.  Tourism is a nearly $7 billion industry, second in the state, with a record in overall spending in lodging, rentals, food and beverage, retail, recreation, and transportation in 2019.  In 2020, Cape May County lost $1.54 billion in direct tourism spending.

With 59% of all countywide residents employed in the tourism industry and the government the second largest employer, it was imperative that our County Commissions develop a plan that would address the economic downturn.  Regular and accurate communication between the government and the residents as needed.  This program ran for two years and the impact of the program resulted in recovery efforts, with an economic return near the 2019 numbers.

April 2020, occupancy was down 99%, and as restrictions were eased tourism revenue increased slightly each month for the next 19 months.  The awareness coupled with the confidence campaign was in full swing and business owners were seeing an uptick in business.  The summer months saw an increase in visitors bolstered by the return of visitors.  By December 2020, tourism direct spending saw the smallest decrease statewide, with an overall decline in spending of 21.1%. However, the actual loss in dollars to the County was $1.54 billion in revenue.  Cape May County’s loss in direct tourism spending was more than 15 of the 21 counties in the state generated.

Employment was down by more than 3,600 hundred jobs, a loss of 13.5%. Visitor loss was 19% in 2020, going from 10.2 million to 8.2 million due to the pandemic.  Revenue and employment losses impact countywide employment year-round.

The “Safely Together” campaign was well thought out and encompassed all levels of communications from County government to residents, second homeowners, visitors, business owners, and local government officials. The tourism season was fast approaching and the loss of potential summer revenue, the impact on local businesses, and the unknown consequences of the shutdown and restrictions were of serious concern.

The Civil Department of the Superior Court (Civil Department) historically appointed arbitrators manually to each case. This process presented many challenges, including ensuring all eligible attorneys are appointed, non-eligible attorneys are not appointed, attorney address information is updated, and information is updated timely to reduce various delays. Before the project presented here, the Civil Department only appointed approximately one-third (1/3) of eligible attorneys, or roughly 3,000, resulting in cases being disproportionately assigned to fewer attorneys and the arbitration process taking longer.
The State Bar of Arizona (State Bar) is responsible for maintaining updated attorney information in Arizona.

As part of this service delivery, Miami-Dade County has 25 County departments that provide various municipal type services with a budgeted staff of approximately 27,593 positions.  In order to ensure the delivery of services over 2,431 square miles, of which 1,898 square miles is on land, the County utilizes and maintains approximately 29 fuel stations servicing 12,000 County operated vehicles and approximately 2,000 local municipal vehicles.

Within the State of Florida, municipal, county and transportation agencies are entitled to claim a partial reimbursement on certain motor fuel taxes paid as outlined within Florida Statute (F. S.) 206.41. The tax reimbursement claim is based on the total gallons of motor fuel used by “on-road” vehicles (e g. cars, trucks, buses, garbage trucks, etc.). 

Within Miami-Dade County, the Internal Services Department (ISD) and the Department of Transit and Public Works (DTPW) provide monthly claims to Florida Department of Revenue (FDOR) for consideration accounting for a combined average of 15 million gallons of unleaded and diesel fuel worth approximately $1.5 million in reimbursements each year.  As a result, ISD implemented the Motor Fuels Taxable Reimbursement program, in April 2020, to track claims and reimbursements helping both the County and FDOR accurately and efficiently process claims and handle discrepancies.

AWD-001644,2022,Risk and Emergency Management,Everbridge Mass Notification System,FL,12086,Miami-Dade County,"Rather than continuing to rely on an assortment of stand alone emergency response plans for different facilities, in early 2019 the Internal Services Department (ISD) of Miami-Dade County began developing a unified All Hazards Emergency Action Plan.  While working through the individual response tasks in the plan, which naturally varied depending on the criticality of the affected facility or nature of the emergency, it became clear that we needed to have a mass notification system capable of allowing us to reach specific groups of people, both large and small, as quickly and reliably as possible.

ISD learned that the State of Florida offers a mass notification system through a contract with Everbridge®, which was and is being used by the Miami Dade Office of Emergency Management (OEM) to send out severe weather alerts.  Discovering we could also access that contract, ISD immediately created its own account.  Shortly after coordinating several meetings with both OEM and Everbridge® representatives, in early 2020 we were faced with the COVID-19 pandemic.  As the virus continued to spread, many “in-person” office activities moved away from our facilities and were performed remotely.  Though the number of employees and visitors in County facilities was drastically reduced and priorities were shifted to adapt to a new normal, we continued to test and implement the Everbridge® mass notification system.

Over the past year, as more and more employees have returned to the workplace and social activities and needs for services have increased, we have encountered numerous incidents and emergencies for which we were able to utilize the Everbridge® mass notification system. Instead of resorting to the time-consuming process of flipping through a notification matrix and making phone calls or sending emails, the ability to send an emergency-specific notification to a programmed, specific group of people, and receive real-time confirmations on receipt of those notifications, has proven invaluable to our response capabilities, both in timeliness and effectiveness.

The fact that it accomplished this feat, while alleviating stress on hospitals and improving patient care, makes it a triumph.

Since its inception, the Bell County Indigent Health Care (BCIHC) department had functioned in largely the same way: residents registered for the program, they received care in area hospitals (often Emergency Departments), and the county reimbursed the hospitals. This model of using Emergency Departments instead of traditional primary care was both more costly and less effective, as patients had no continuity of care.

Through this collaborative, the county partnered with two community clinics, establishing them as the primary care providers for all BCIHC patients. To receive care, BCIHC patients must visit one of the clinics, where they receive both primary and specialty care, as well as prescription medications that the clinics are able to get deeply discounted through existing grants funds and prescription assistance programs (PAP).

One and a half years later, Riverside County’s IHSS clients and caregivers are using over forty templates to sign hundreds of documents a month, saving much of the time, energy, and resources used with the traditional method of signing, verifying, transporting, and storing documents. Moreover, Adobe Sign was a secure, cost-effective, efficient, paperless, and user-friendly platform used by over 40,000 IHSS clients and almost 34,000 caregivers during the last year. Online services such as Adobe Sign have created a more seamless and efficient system that has improved IHSS client access and satisfaction.",Awarded
AWD-001665,2022,Health,CAREGIVERS MATTER: INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES TO INCREASE CAREGIVER ENROLLMENT,CA,06065,Riverside County,"Accelerated growth in Riverside County's aging population coupled with government-mandated shutdowns due to the pandemic in the last two years, have led to an increased demand for In-Home-Supportive-Services (IHSS) and accordingly an increased demand for IHSS caregivers. IHSS is provided to Medi-Cal beneficiaries who are low-income including individuals who are aged, blind, or disabled and require assistance to live independently in their homes and prevent out-of-home placement. The increased need for IHSS, and COVID-19, have contributed to a climate of economic uncertainty, reduced staffing levels, and a deterioration of social supports, putting an increased number of vulnerable seniors and disabled adults at risk of losing their health and independence. To meet these challenges, the IHSS-Public Authority (IHSS-PA) implemented several innovative technological approaches and creative outreach strategies to successfully recruit, train, and enroll caregivers and continue to support the emergency needs of the County’s elderly and disabled residents to remain safely in their homes. The IHSS-PA’s efforts resulted in a significant decrease in the wait-time for successful completion of IHSS caregiver orientation and enrollment activities; and significant increases in the number of caregivers who were successfully enrolled and available for back-up emergency services.",Awarded

Flagler County has almost tripled their population. With this population growth it has been noted that teens are the hardest demographic to attract to the library. Through research and trial and error, the Young Adult Services Program or YASP was created to provide teens a welcoming, inclusive, and safe environment within Flagler County. If you build it, they will come, so we were optimistic that teens would come and develop a love for learning and literacy. In response to the population growth, the library developed a state-of-the-art young adult space called the Teen Spot, which opened in early 2020. This center provides teens with access to technology, materials, and a space to call their own. The program today consists of classes/demonstrations, meet-ups, lectures, and teen volunteer opportunities.

•	Creating internal efficiencies; by involving in the process internal stakeholders who are responsible in multiple departments for managing the technical procurement process. This collaboration allows all county departments to now use uniform language, format, justification, etc.; approving transactions faster; requiring fewer corrections.
•	Reducing risk and enhancing our reputation in the supplier community as a fair and consistent business partner, operating in compliance with procurement laws and regulations.

Prince William County utilizes a “decentralized/centralized” procurement model. Departments are not required to send individual requests for sourcing to Procurement Services. The Prince William County Procurement Regulations grants departments the authority to purchase goods and services directly under a certain dollar threshold, with minimal intervention by Procurement Services. 

The success of the program, in a post COVID-19 world, provides online training and guidance to both new and seasoned staff. The training is available on any device and from any location. The direct result is that the number of purchase orders that the procurement office needs to reject, or return, has declined. This is allowing for faster turnaround time in the creation and issuance of purchase orders and solicitations. Procurement Officers can refer users to the course material instead of repeating live 1:1 training, freeing up the Procurement Officer's time to focus on strategic sourcing. End users are more confident and accepting of the procurement process, improving the quality of collaboration across departments. The County is better protected because users have more clarity about the procurement principles and laws in Virginia, reducing the likelihood that appropriate competition will not be achieved.

Public safety was the top priority for the more than 26,000 residents who responded to the Thrive305 survey, the largest public engagement initiative in Miami-Dade County government’s history. In response to residents’ concerns and a simultaneous uptick in gun violence, Miami-Dade County designed and adopted the Peace & Prosperity Plan (“the Plan”) with unanimous support from its Board of County Commissioners. The Plan commits nearly $90 million, over a period of 19 years, in proceeds from a naming rights deal for the County-owned sports and entertainment arena and home to the Miami-Heat, to strengthen the County’s community violence prevention and intervention infrastructure. 

The Plan is a comprehensive, evidence-based, and best-practice driven strategy to address the social and economic disparities at the root of gun violence and poverty in Miami-Dade County. The Plan aims to reduce violence, promote safety and prosperity, and create thriving neighborhoods through a strategic prevention, intervention, and reentry approach with a focus on the communities most affected. Most importantly, the Plan embodies the core values of a Miami-Dade County that is inclusive and equitable and supports all residents to achieve their dream regardless of race, nationality, and economic status

The County established an incident command structure and created 9 sectors and 13 sub-sectors to facilitate regular communication, coordination, resource allocation, and to address other needs. The sharing of vital testing, tracing, treatment, and vaccination resources made it possible for COVID-19 tests to be performed at the border, where over 150,000 individuals cross northbound each day (1). Through various pilot programs, over 39,000 vaccines were delivered to Baja California residents who lived, worked, and played across the border. The Binational Sector, working on behalf of the County in cross-border efforts, hosted 37 telebriefings with strategic binational partners in attendance, and aided in the sharing of educational materials, and personal-protective-equipment. Through the Live Well San Diego vision of achieving a healthy, safe, and thriving region, the County paved the way in fostering binational intergovernmental communication, coordination, and collaboration to support one another and address mutual concerns brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Opa-locka Branch Library developed a virtual programming series, Getting Started with Genealogy, to reach an often-underserved adult audience, especially those older adults who were most vulnerable to the physical and emotional stresses of the pandemic. By crafting this series, staff hoped to develop relationships with physically isolated patrons and residents interested in genealogical and historical research.

Classical music is played lightly in the background to create a relaxing atmosphere. The painting chosen for the demonstration is carefully selected to ensure it is not too difficult for children but not too simple for adults. The instructor provides encouragement to foster a positive and welcoming environment conducive for creative expression to flourish. 

This program was originally conceived to give students an opportunity to express themselves through art.

This opened the door for additional resource sharing that has led to other ways we are able to now offer our assistance within the schools, such as hosting a book club at detention once a week to help troubled students learn to love reading by introducing them to a variety of young adult selections.  

Palm Springs North Branch Library staff were contacted by a school counselor at Lake Stevens Middle School to see if library staff would be available for an after-school program in which library staff would share information about the library’s programs and services offerings. During this outreach, the PSN Branch Manager connected with the school’s new media specialist who was also new to librarianship. The PSN Manager offered to assist the school’s media specialist with preparing the media center to open for the school year. Public library staff helped the school media specialist by reshelving books and reorganizing the media center in a way that would benefit the school’s students. Library staffs’ willingness to assist the media specialist opened new doors for MDPLS to assist the school in other ways. The PSN Branch Manager attended school staff meetings to help other teachers learn about the services provided by MDPLS, which in turn created other connections that led to a PSN Branch book club held at the school during detention.   
 
Because book club sessions were mandatory for students who had been assigned to go to detention, attendees were exposed to new themes and books they would not have been aware of otherwise. Some students expressed interest in reading the books after detention hall was over. Some students developed a love for reading during the book club sessions. Library staff created a book return system for these children since many of them did not have a way to return the items to the library due to transportation issues, one of the reasons some of the students had never been to visit the library before. Library staff found a way to combat this issue by bringing the library and all its resources to the school, and they also created a relationship with the school. Palm Springs North Branch Library staff are creatively coming up with methods for partnering with schools to reach students and teachers alike.

This web-based application is available 24 hours / 7 days a week and exists to standardize permit data entry from the 40 individual municipalities located throughout Palm Beach County to the Property Appraiser’s Office (PAO). The Permit Portal created a standard to improve permit data integrity and eliminates data entry errors, while keeping the data entry interface simple and easy to use. For larger municipalities, it created a process to allow for automated permit data transfers with the same standards of improving data integrity and eliminating data entry errors.  Municipalities such as the City of Boynton Beach, Village of Wellington, Town of Ocean Ridge, and the properties in the Unincorporated Palm Beach County area are now transmitting their data in a standardized format to the PAO, which ensures that their new additions are placed on the yearly Tax Roll.  Each municipality is given the option to submit their data using Excel, FTP, API and/or direct portal data entry. Each municipality has been provided with a dashboard to view the permit and property value information in an interactive visual format. The portal application has a process to remind municipality users to close open permits, allows the users to update the Certificate of Occupancy/Certificate of Completion (COO /COC) information, and posts the COO/COC to the Tax Roll application.

The application was completed, tested and moved into our production environment in Mid-March of 2021.  The Permit Portal is currently being utilized by all municipalities successfully and achieved all four-success factor metrics of ensuring quality of content, usability, accessibility and accurate transmission of data. The team responsible for the Permit Portal website was a close coordination of the PAO and ISS. The employees working on this portal worked nights and weekends to overcome obstacles encountered during the design, implementation and testing phases of this project.  The work of these employees has created a much higher level of property tax roll data integrity to county citizens, as well as to all municipalities needing value and permit information at the tip of their fingers.

Previously, residents had no options to recycle this bulky and difficult-to-handle material, as Styrofoam is not accepted in traditional curbside and drop-off recycling programs. Recycling this material aligns with Montgomery County’s mission to help residents divert as much material as possible from the landfill and turn waste into resources. 

In 2021, MCES partnered with local communities and organizations to hold a series of one-day community collections of Styrofoam for recycling. Hundreds of residents brought more than 10,000 pounds of Styrofoam across four recycling events in 2021-22. A local company processed more than five tons of Styrofoam from these events to repurpose the material. 

MCES collaborated with local municipal governments, park districts, and community environmental organizations to provide this new service efficiently and cost effectively. The collection events have been drawing residents from throughout the Miami Valley region and have been very well received by the public. Due to the great success of these efforts, MCES will continue to hold these one-day events as we develop a permanent year-round Styrofoam recycling program for our residents.

Violence perpetrated by an intimate partner as part of a pattern of coercion and control often results in violence victims being unable or unwilling to engage in community resources and the criminal justice system for a variety of reasons.  Experience and research confirm that immediate intervention with DV victims after a violent incident by system professionals and resource providers increases victim engagement in protective community systems.  DV ART is the first program of its kind developed in the State of Colorado.  DV ART is a team of two prosecutors and one investigator employed with the Boulder County District Attorney’s Office with decades of combined experience responding to and prosecuting DV cases.

At one point, a 15-minute phone call from the Juvenile Justice Center (JJC) cost $12.75.

For eight consecutive months, teens attended workshops and developed skills that help increase the likelihood for their success. FMYI programs are grounded in peer-reviewed and trauma-informed research, applying social-emotional learning through art and technology.  

To reach its target population, MDPLS forged strategic partnerships with county departments and community-based organizations. These partners include, the Miami-Dade Juvenile Services Department (JSD), which provides outlets for at-risk youth, the Miami-Dade Police Department’s (MDPD) Youth Outreach Unit (YOU), which offers alternatives for high-risk teens affected by gun violence, and Citrus Family Care Network, which supports foster care children. MDPLS also works closely with the Southeast Florida Library Information Network (SEFLIN) which is a library cooperative whose mission is to empower South Florida libraries. SEFLIN increases the reach of the FMYI and encourages other member libraries to design similar programs. Interdepartmental partnerships with JSD and MDPD help address the shared issues of juvenile crime, delinquent behavior, and childhood trauma in the community. 

During FMYI programs, participating teens attend workshops and learn to create art and multimedia. They also learn to improve their communication and critical thinking skills, helping ease anxiety and improving their overall well-being. The teens’ artwork is often showcased online or featured during the final culminating celebration, the FMYI Teen Film Festival which highlights the works created by teens in Miami-Dade as well as teens from around the world, from as far as Africa, South America, and Europe. The festival provides a chance for works to be recognized and for youth to become aware of shared experiences with teens who live far away, bringing them closer and allowing them to learn from one another.

The purpose of creating a regional design manual was to take a watershed-based approach to stormwater management. As water knows no political boundary, if all development in a region was required to meet the same standards-based on watershed goals, and not jurisdictional boundaries, water quality and water quantity standards would be a collaborative effort. A consultant was brought on board, and through the work of a technical subcommittee made up of the participating jurisdictions, the Southern Lowcountry (SoLoCo) Design Manual was created. The SoLoCo manual requires the use of green infrastructure, low-impact development, and better site design standards to achieve water quality and water quantity requirements in the Lowcountry. Requiring such standards in the Lowcountry is a move to keep our region more resilient as weather and local flooding issues continue to evolve. Since the final document was created in March of 2020, two of the six participating jurisdictions have implemented the manual. Beaufort County began implementing the manual in February 2021.

Fare capping is now possible with the Paradise Pass, which results in a significant savings for frequent riders who take more than two bus trips a day. For monthly pass holders, the Paradise Pass allows them to pay as they go, instead of purchasing a monthly pass upfront. 

Designed to evolve, the Paradise Pass will roll-out other benefits for riders and provide Palm Tran’s planning team real-time data to be used for developing and improving fixed-routes.

AWD-001806,2022,Human Services,"Riverside County Office on Aging's Holistic Assessment, Resources, & Transitions for Seniors (HARTS)",CA,06065,Riverside County,"ABSTRACT
Riverside County Office on Aging’s Holistic Assessment, Resources, & Transitions for Seniors (HARTS) integrates several key services into one seamless program that increases positive health outcomes for hospitalized seniors with a history of abuse or neglect. HARTS’ innovation is grounded on effectively weaving four core service approaches from varied funding sources into one viable coordinated safety net for seniors: Hospital Transition, Professional Nursing Care Follow-Up, Caregiver Support, and Medical Case Management.
Adult Protective Services (APS) clients are referred to HARTS upon hospital admission with the goals of immediate engagement and service planning coordination prior to discharge. Immediate direct linkage results in effective coordination of professional supports from varied disciplines ensuring: 1) follow-through of essential safety and protective measures; 2) completion of medical treatment plans; and 3) delivery of long-term community supports.
Program outcomes have been successful in that 92% of clients who accepted HARTS services effectively managed their health care goals and reduced protective (APS) risk concerns after discharge. More specifically, re-admission within 30 days of discharge is reduced to 5% of cohort (4 of 75 clients); and re-admission within 60 days of discharge is reduced to 3% of cohort (2 of 75 clients).
NEED FOR THE PROGRAM
According to the California Department of Social Services, the Adult Protective Service (APS) Program investigates over 150,000 reports of elder and dependent adult abuse each year. The regulatory mandate for APS is to conduct investigations of abuse or neglect toward elderly or disabled adults, typically over a narrow period of 30 to 60 days, and offer available remediation. However, 80% of all APS cases in California are closed in less than 60 days, with 90% closed within 90 days1. Despite the agency’s best intentions, lack of funding – coupled with increasing need – make long-term case follow-up a rarity.
Seniors and disabled adults identified by APS who would benefit from hospital discharge planning and in-home case management require attention that is outside the scope of current APS regulations. These individuals will typically interface with numerous healthcare staff and caseworkers from varied agencies as they cycle from hospital to home and subsequent readmission. Studies show that among seniors 65 and older, hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge range from 12.5 to 16.7 percent. With self-neglect being the most reported type of abuse, lack of medical follow-through and risks of emergency readmission continue to be an ongoing concern.",Awarded

Knowing where to find the data can be challenging for the average person. Therefore, Mecklenburg County Finance developed a public website (Exhibit A) in order to:
o	Enhance communication between the County and the public
o	Provide line of site to the economic health of the County 
o	Streamline data and information into a singular area/ site for general ease of use
o	Reword technical economic terms into terms that are more understandable for the public

The reports on this website were structured in an easy to find format with all of the pertinent data on that topic. For example, the housing reports takes data from the MLS system and structures it to show data for Mecklenburg County and its submarkets such as specific townships and cities within the County like Charlotte and Matthews.

Through this program, volunteers assess ponds, landscapes, and stream sides that, through the years, have grown shady, stagnant and may threaten natural resource conservation during a weather event. The Master Gardeners document the issues through photos, samples of pond weed and water, and survey the surrounding landscape. They then provide property owners a detailed report, including options that can help them better maintain their own landscape and, as a result, a healthy ecosystem.

At minimal cost to the county, the Site Assessment program offers a new service to Loudoun County residents and property owners or managers, without any service fee. Expanding the county’s community outreach education, the Master Gardeners assist in best management practices that contribute to natural resource conservation.

The team implemented lean continuous improvement practices using an A3 8-step problem-solving tool to develop countermeasures to test new processes. In August 2021, the team tested a new workflow they nicknamed the “suspended missing information (MI)” process. Various measures including the time it took for a client to receive an eligibility determination, the number of case touches, application approval rate, and staff satisfaction with the new workflow were measured to compare to baseline data to see if the new process improved the outcome for a client’s application. Most dramatically, the average number of case touches decreased from 5.3 to 3.8 indicating processing efficiency gains. Additionally, the average number of days it took a client to get a determination decreased from 36 to 25. This is a significant 11-day time saving which when applied to a family’s life could mean the financial savings of $699 (based on 9 weekdays of a level 3 provider infant reimbursement rate).

As with many jurisdictions in California, SBC experienced a surge in July 2020 after the initial lockdown eased.  CCTP was unable to interview all incoming COVID-19 cases, resulting in gaps of descriptive data used to understand the evolving pandemic among SBC residents.  The CCTP initiated a Recovery interview process in September 2020, through which we interviewed cases ≥90 days after the onset of symptoms or first positive test. From September 2020 through December 2021, CCTP has interviewed 206,320 former cases, or 56.8% of the total cases eligible for a Recovery interview.  As a result, case data now provides a more complete epidemiologic picture of COVID-19 transmission, morbidity, and mortality among SBC residents.  Many residents expressed appreciation for assistance in linking them to needed social services.

RISE was designed as a revolving loan program for micro and small business owners - the first of its kind in Miami-Dade County. 

The Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners funded the program through a $25 million allocation from the Federal CARES Act. As a true public-private partnership, Dade County Federal Credit Union (DCFCU), a local, leading financial institution with more than 80 years of community lending experience, administers the program.

In six short months - and by the original Federal government mandated deadline -  RISE provided over $20 million in low interest loans to 900 small businesses across Miami-Dade, supporting 4,500 families.

While it provided immediate relief, RISE is designed to be a long-term revolving loan program to serve as an engine for growth in Miami-Dade’s small business community. The initial tranche of RISE loans also provided the richest data on local small businesses to date. Lessons learned are serving as a roadmap for how to strengthen the small business ecosystem that is the backbone of the local economy, particularly in district Commissioner Higgins serves.

Three new Probation Officer positions were created, with two of the officers placed full time at high volume local courts, to work with the courts to increase both collaboration and case volume.  Additionally, each officer was given a geographic territory and was tasked with establishing relationships with those corresponding courts.
With the emphasis on geographically expanded RUS, cases from outside the City of Buffalo went from an average of ten cases per year from 2017-2019 to 284 and 269 in 2020 and 2021, respectively.

Voter Service and Polling Centers (VSPCs) offer voting equipment for people with disabilities, same-day registration, and additional services such as replacement ballots. While the COVID-19 pandemic didn’t change things for most Colorado voters—95% of whom return their ballots via mail or drop box—it did pose a significant challenge with respect to the 5% who use VSPC locations. 

Jefferson County, which has about 430,000 registered voters, stretches from the western suburbs of Denver to more rural areas in the Rocky Mountain foothills. To keep voters and election workers safe, the Jeffco Elections division came up with some creative solutions. First, the team retrofitted an enclosed trailer into a mobile vote center so that voters could obtain services outside at a VSPC too small for social distancing or election workers could relocate the trailer to a VSPC in case of an emergency closure. We then took our largest vote centers and split them into two by adding large tents with generators and voting equipment in the parking lots. That enabled us to process twice the voters, increasing efficiency and reducing crowds, while enabling voters to cast ballots outside, which entails a lower risk of transmission.

The Integrated Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) COVID Outbreak Response and Infection Prevention Education Program (LTCF CORE Program) provides on-site testing and vaccination; infection and outbreak prevention and control guidance; and technical support to skilled nursing facilities, memory care facilities, board & care homes, and other congregate living facilities in Solano County that serve primarily elderly and/or disabled residents. The program is designed to save lives by reducing severe outcomes and deaths among those at highest risk.  

The LTCF CORE Program has three prongs: 1.) the Epidemiology/Outbreak Investigation and Response Team (Epi team); 2.) the LTCF Infection Prevention and Education Team (IP team); and 3.) the Testing Team. The LTCF CORE Program is comprised of Health and Social Services staff from a variety of programs and backgrounds. It was first assembled in April 2020 by redirecting existing staff and engaging community partners. The LTCF CORE Program has responded to more than 500 outbreaks since the start of the pandemic, and successfully fosters communication with long-term care facilities, develops and refines tailored infection prevention and control plans, reduces the impact of COVID-19 outbreaks, and contributes to significantly lower death rates in Solano County compared to other areas.

Unfortunately, educators and industry role models have had challenges connecting due to time, location, and networks. The Maricopa County School Superintendent's Office developed an online platform, Educator Pro Connect (EPC), to overcome these obstacles and make it easy for educators to connect with industry role models. In the platform educators indicate information about the subjects they teach, types of engagement, and methods for connections. The industry professionals provide information about their careers and details about preferred connection activities. EPC automatically matches teachers to professionals based on cross-referenced Arizona K-12 Academic Standards, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and details about connection activities. The EPC platform drives these outcomes: 1.  Increase student career identity across Maricopa County, especially in middle and high schools, low-income, and rural areas. 2. Provide schools with a network of industry professionals willing to engage with students and educators. 3.  Provide companies and industry professionals ease of connection to volunteer their time and support future economic and workforce development. 4.

Rural resort communities have higher than average rates of suicide and substance use disorder.  With dysfunctional State-wide funding systems under review, Summit County Government decided that immediate and local action was necessary.  In 2017 Summit County worked with community stakeholders on a yearlong process to identify service gaps, areas of greatest need, proven strategies and cost estimates for mental health programs. This work resulted in a roadmap built to strengthen the continuum of local mental health services. In 2018, Summit County voters approved ballot measure 1A, Strong Future, which included approximately $2M annually to support behavioral health services.  Since the passage of the Strong Future fund, Summit County Government has partnered with numerous entities to stand up new programming and bolster existing, underfunded services.

The 39 employees that comprise the supportive services units provide critical administrative support to the Department’s more than 1,100 employees. Support staff are often the first person justice-involved individuals encounter at local probation offices.  They are asked to complete a number of administrative tasks such as enter restitution payments, update the Department’s case management system, transfer cases to other offices, and maintain performance measures for the unit which they serve.  Each probation office houses a team of support staff that provide these supportive services.  In 2020, support staff supervisors identified an opportunity to better distribute the work assigned to support staff. Through collaboration between multiple divisions and teams across the Department, a centralized workflow process was created.

The existing assignment procedure, based on receipt of a physical file, increased the risk of lost files, created a workload burden for support staff and delayed or even prohibited the assignment of these individuals to a CRU officer, which potentially resulted in fewer or no services while in custody. CRU developed a new assignment process, that eliminated the need for CRU to receive a physical file in order to assign the individual and begin supervision and transition planning. CRU’s new fileless system has resulted in faster and more accurate assignments both in and out of custody.

•	2030 Clean Fleet Goal.
•	Electric Vehicle (EV) Planning and Investments 
•	SolarTogether, a solar subscription program of Florida Power and Light (FPL)

The Broward County Board of County Commissioners (Board) set its first greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals in 2008 and has repeatedly increased the County’s ambition, most recently with a 2021 resolution to reduce GHG emissions to net zero by 2050. This target sets a framework for reducing emissions in the various operational sectors, broadly divided into transportation and building projects. 

The County began a concerted effort to reduce electricity in its facilities through energy services contracts, followed by significant investments in solar photovoltaic systems, designed to reduce its reliance on the local grid. Through participation in the FPL SolarTogether program, which provides utility scale PV projects, the County has offset its remaining usage.

The County’s vehicle fleet was targeted for conversion to electric vehicles by the Board with its adoption of a goal to limit fleet purchases to only zero-emissions vehicles by 2030. After extensive collaboration on electric vehicle planning and investments, the County commissioned an engineering study to determine key sites to support this transition, by identifying electrical service requirements and costs. The Fleet Services Division then created a five-year plan for the installation of EV charging stations to meet demand over the next decade.

It was anticipated that a phased-in approach would be best to administer at least a first dose of the vaccine over a 32 week period starting in mid-December 2020, but a year later it became apparent that the plan in place needed to be refined and more targeted to address the information war and the speed at which the virus spread.",Awarded

In 2019, this program focused on the mosquito species Aedes aegypti – vector of Zika, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses – a notoriously difficult species to control, and critically important species with respect to human health (as well as economic well-being). In 2020, Culex quinquefasciatus was added to the program, as this species transmits West Nile virus. The Zika virus outbreak in Miami-Dade, Florida in 2016 heightened the need for monitoring mosquitoes for insecticide resistance in order to respond disease outbreaks. Monitoring for resistance in the vector population is essential to determine control failures, should they occur.

The program consisted of a comprehensive field study and systematic collection of the eggs of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. Once these field-collected egg samples were processed, they were shipped to UF/IFAS FMEL. In 2019, we sampled seven locations and in 2020, we increased sampling sites to 32 locations throughout Miami-Dade County.

After the careful and intensive study concluded, we found that some mosquito populations had indeed developed a resistance to the pesticides. The results of this program determined that if resistance is not monitored and properly managed, mitigation efforts could become inefficient. ",Awarded

The pandemic also exposed the need for accessible mental health support and deficiencies in current mental health resources made available by most employers.  Although most County agencies provide some mental health benefits, most have not made awareness of mental health resources a priority.  

To address these concerns, Howard County Government developed the “Enhanced Mental Health Program” initiative to provide comprehensive resources to help employees and their dependents address mental health concerns and manage stress.  Through strategic partnerships with local organizations, and insurers, Howard County has employed several creative strategies to significantly improve education, enhance access to resources, and reduce costs to the County and its employees.     

The expanded mental health program has made Howard County a trailblazer both at the State and national levels.

Tarrant County, the third largest county in Texas, has a jail capacity of over 5,000 inmates. Jail operations were being managed by a decades old legacy system with a myriad of ancillary applications tied on as the complexity of managing a jail grew with the daily population. This legacy system had reached end of life and replacement was a requirement. In the absence of what Tarrant County thought was an acceptable Consumer Off the Shelf (COTS) jail management application, the county decided to build their own system to modernize jail operations and fully integrate with the existing Tarrant County criminal justice “ecosystem” to maximize their collective operational capabilities. In partnership with a software development team that was part of a local government corporation, Tarrant County built from the ground up a highly functional and configurable application that manages all aspect of operating a jail. The application successfully deployed on January 11, 2022. It has provided the benefits originally intended and many unforeseen.

This Ordinance is implemented by the Parks, Recreation, and Open Spaces Department, Special Assessment Districts Division (SADD).

To comply with this requirement, SADD receives requests from realtors, title companies, and other customers looking for a verification letter that can confirm or deny the existence of special taxing districts. These requests have always come via mail or email and would cost the requester $15 for each folio property requiring research. In addition, the turnaround time for these letters would take, on average, 48 hours, or for those requiring a faster turnover could pay $30 for an expedited request. This created the need for SADD to establish escrow accounts to allow title companies to deposit enough funds to cover the cost of multiple requests.  

Since implementing our program, verification letter requests prepared by SADD staff dropped to an average of 200 letters monthly within the last six (6) months compared to the previous standard of 1,400 letters monthly.

Maximizing investments, delivering fast and effective services, and having the ability to deploy new applications and systems rapidly are quickly becoming the new norm. As a result, the Clerk’s office partnered with VMware and Dell to modernize our data centers to ensure high availability and security for applications and data essential to support the operations of the Court and Judicial Branch. As more and more services are moved online to improve our Customer Experience, the expectation is those services are accessible 24/7/365.

Formerly applications for deferral or waiver were accepted as physical copies via the Clerk’s Office filing counters and routed manually using email. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Clerk’s Office set out to limit in-person contact as much as possible and developed an online solution for the acceptance and processing of applications for deferral or waiver.  

The new solution uses a suite of software tools already available for use with the Clerk’s Electronic Document Management System including automated workflow, electronic forms, and an integrated cloud-based file sharing service to create the online application and approval process for deferrals and waivers.  The solution was completed in under one year from inception to go-live resulting in a user-friendly form that helps ensure applications for deferral or waiver are submitted  properly and processed in a secure, consistent, and timely manner.

Individuals starting a new Family, Civil, or Tax case with the Court can apply to have payment of filing fees and/or other court fees and costs deferred (meaning they need to pay later) or waived (waivers, which excuse payment completely, are rarely granted at the beginning of a case).  Applications for deferral or waiver require detailed information related to the individual’s finances which allow the system to automate the approval of some deferrals while those requiring further review are automatically routed to Clerk of the Court staff and/or Court Administration and an assigned Judicial Officer for review.  Once applications have been fully reviewed, the system generates Orders either granting or denying the application.  Orders approving the deferral or waiver of fees are sent to the applicant with instructions for including the approval documentation when filing their case.  Denied orders are sent to the application indicating the reason for denial and further instructions if applicable.

Due to the continuing pandemic, the majority of the Court and legal community continue to work remotely and participate in the majority of hearings virtually via Microsoft Teams.  The expansion of eFiling to accommodate case initiating petitions has made it possible for attorneys and parties to file important court documents from an alternative work site instead of having to travel to a court building in person, during business hours only, to file documents.  

In Juvenile Court, the majority of case initiating filings are submitted primarily by attorneys or agencies who work within larger organizations.

Not surprisingly, reflective of state and national trends, the designated sites are not reflective of County demographics and history.  For example, Miami-Dade County is 70% Latinx, and only 1% of designated sites reflect this heritage. As part of this effort, OHP also analyzed state level data for Florida, which reflects a similar lack of diversity.

This data audit led to a broader discussion of equity in planning and zoning, prompting OHP staff to undertake a deep research dive into the history of planning and zoning policies and how those have resulted in decades of inequitable policy implementation.

This dynamic regulatory program has been amended regularly throughout the past 54 years in response to the ever-changing needs of the community and advances in technology, from adding prohibitions on deceptive trade practices in 1973 (Sec. 8A-113 of the Code) to prohibiting price screen obstruction in 1994 (Sec. 8A-111.1) to administering the County’s Wage Theft Program in 2013 (Chapter 22 of the Code).

The cornerstone of this Program has been the investigation and mediation of consumer complaints and the provision of consumer awareness and education to the public handled by the Office of Consumer Protection’s Mediation Section in the Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources.  The onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 caused a seismic shift in the traditional delivery of government services globally.

It was determined that a proactive role in contacting the responsible parties was needed. As part of this initiative, a specialized call group was established to identify cases that would benefit from this program and enable voluntary compliance. The selection of lien cases was based on those that had a Notice of Intent to Lien (NOIL), lien recorded, cases pending to be transferred to the County’s Finance Department, cases with default agreements, and cases where compliance with correcting the violation was achieved and an outstanding balance remained. The objective was to contact the responsible parties and provide them with compliance information, as well as advise of available hardship settlements that would provide a more affordable option than allowing the case to progress. This was seen as an incentive by the public to comply and resulted in an increase of compliance cases and liens settled. ",Awarded

Departments were tasked with creating cost savings while continuing to deliver quality services to the community. Jeffco had recently established an Innovation program and this team played a key role in developing a Unified Cellular Services program to help departments generate cost savings.

The Innovation Team conducted an analysis on county cellular services and identified an opportunity to significantly reduce annual operating costs. With help from county departments, the team organized comprehensive network and user testing across the county’s geographic area. The results showed that the county could switch thousands of cellular devices to a new network at a lower monthly fee while still maintaining quality service. Departments were impressed by the competitive coverage and decided to start migrating their devices to the new network in 2021.

By the end of 2021, over 600 devices across many departments had been converted. This will generate savings of over $800,000 over the next five years.  Additional departments are migrating their devices in 2022 which will deliver another $1.35 million in savings over five years.

The outcome was as expected and here are a few examples:
* Automated the account creation with default groups and access so the employee could login and work on the first day of employment.
* Automated account deletion after termination so that the employee cannot login and minimized risk of any access after termination.
* Automated transfers between departments so account access was setup with the default groups and the employee was productive right away.

Orange County has strategically developed and funded the creation of multiple residential solar programs and energy efficiency programs such as SELF, Florida Solar United Neighbors (SUN), and the Senior Climate Efficiency Program while increasing internal solar installations on municipal facilities. 

Through these programs, Orange County is increasing its renewable energy portfolio, offsetting energy burdens for residents through low-interest financing and energy efficiency upgrades. In addition, these programs promote solar for homeowners by providing consumers options to purchase solar in bulk and driving down prices to expand renewable energy efforts.

7MW in producing renewable energy on municipal buildings engaged close to 1,000 interested residents through energy efficiency and solar programs and has insisted that homeowners in solar installations produce 3,638 kW of residential solar, generating more than $8.3 million in economic development and has an offset of 56,240 metric tons of carbon.

AWD-002046,2022,Health,Leveraging Omni-Channel Communications Technology to Improve Public Health Access,WA,53033,King County,"King County, WA is changing how communities connect with public healthcare. We’re making it easier for residents to access services 24 hours a day, no matter where you live or what language you speak – and without the hassle of traveling to downtown Seattle or taking time away from work and family.

Since the first U.S. COVID cases were detected in King County in early 2020, our public health services quickly adopted what we call an “omni-channel engagement” communications strategy that leverages several advanced technologies. These include: a shared regional database for testing, positive cases, and vaccinations; chatbots that assist residents on the phone or online; an appointment scheduling system in residents’ preferred languages; automated text/email appointment reminders; and even a mobile phone app that holds your place in line while you wait in the comfort (and germ-free safety) of your car for health services. Powerful real-time dashboards and analytics help residents and local leaders make data-driven decisions that keep our communities healthy and informed.  

This world-class technology was implemented in response to COVID, but has transformed how residents access public health and is helping make King County a place where all people can live, work and thrive.",Awarded

Customers who would come to the Permitting and Inspection Center or Overtown Transit Village to drop off papers plans for building permit issuance or program permitting were no longer able to do so due to building closures.  Within days of facility closures, RER created an electronic portal to allow applicants to submit applications and plans online. The portal allowed applicants to upload their own PDFs of required application/plan documents for submittal and review directly to the department’s plan review system known as GoldKey.  The portal provides for plans to be uploaded into GoldKey that sequences, assigns, and tracks reviews by staff. This software allows applicants (and the public) to view the status of their plans and their final disposition through dashboards or portals accessed by entering permit or application numbers.  This interactive portal eliminates the need for patrons to travel and visit the department’s permitting facility to submit application documents and plans as well as reduces the time spent in processing and administering these paper submissions specifically in the number of days necessary for reviews to be conducted by plans examiners as paper plans were routed from desk to desk.  In addition, other time and cost savings are realized with the reduction of document copies, the amount of space required to store such paper, and the effort and costs that went into the digitizing process for the archiving of these documents.",Awarded

Several reaches of the LMR were historically degraded through road and stream crossings and dredging/artificial straightening of the stream corridor and historic wetlands, resulting in an incised channel hydrologically disconnected from adjacent riparian floodplain and wetland areas, which originally provided high quality habitat for aquatic and terrestrial species of local conservation interest (SLCIs). The Department has improved the form and function of the LMR by creating a channel that is appropriately sized for its watershed, connected to a regularly inundated floodplain and wetlands, and has a self-sustaining, natural meander geometry. Three different wetlands were restored for SLCIs: an ephemeral wooded wetland for amphibians and reptiles, an emergent marsh providing spawning habitat for native fish, and a deeper, open water marsh for migratory and resident songbirds, waterfowl and shorebirds. During the project, the parcel was acquired by Ozaukee County and added to the County Park System as the Little Menomonee River Fish and Wildlife Preserve.",Awarded

The Macomb County Prosecutor’s Office may be the first county office in the nation to use Google technology to provide desktop and mobile access to information about court hearings as a dashboard. Court dockets are the schedule of cases and hearings before a judge on any given day. The District Court Docket Dashboard automates access by combining 9 different district court dockets for approximately 15 assistant prosecuting attorneys (called assistant district attorneys in some states) who handle thousands of district court cases per year.

It is challenging for assistant prosecuting attorneys to track the cases on the dockets of the county’s various district courts. Courts frequently change their criminal case dockets, as a result of urgent matters being added, new criminal cases being scheduled, cases being resolved, or adjournments being granted. This task becomes even more challenging for the assistant prosecuting attorneys who handle cases in multiple district courts.

AWD-002088,2022,"County Resiliency: Infrastructure, Energy, and Sustainability",F. Wayne Hill Membrane Filtration Project,GA,13135,Gwinnett County,"The F. Wayne Hill Water Resources Center is Gwinnett County’s largest and most advanced wastewater treatment facility. With a permitted capacity of 60 million gallons per day, this facility uses complex physical, biological, and chemical treatment processes to treat domestic and industrial wastewaters. While the facility has consistently treated the water to the highest standard, one process presented significant operational challenges – the membrane filtration process. This process, designed to remove particles as small as 0.04 microns (almost 2,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair), is subject to reduced performance when contaminants accumulate on and within the membranes, commonly referenced as “membrane fouling.”

The purpose of this project was to optimize the membrane filtration process to reduce fouling and restore the performance of the membrane filtration process. Based on the findings of this multi-year effort, Gwinnett County changed its pretreatment additive from an iron-based chemical to an aluminum-based chemical. This change reduced the fouling potential of the feed water, as well as the operating pressures and chemical costs for the membrane filtration process. In addition, the performance of five membrane trains severely fouled with iron was restored with an oxalic acid cleaning solution that further reduced the operating pressures. Together, these actions reduced Gwinnett County’s operating costs by more than $450,000 per year and allowed Gwinnett County to realize more than $800,000 in savings in the 22 months since conversion.

The cruise industry is a critical component of the local economy in Miami-Dade County. According to a 2017 Martin Associates study, PortMiami generated approximately 30,100 direct and indirect jobs via the cruise industry, and according to an analysis performed by the Beacon Council, Inc., cruise lines comprise three of the fifteen largest employers in Miami- Dade County. As of 2017, the cruise industry had a positive annual economic impact of approximately $5.8 billion for Miami-Dade County. That amount was projected to increase based on the expansion of the cruise industry at PortMiami. 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic was a natural disaster beyond reasonable control, potentially triggering the force majeure clause in PortMiami’s cruise agreements. The PortMiami’s Cruise Restart program included creation of the Americas Seaport Committee in collaboration with most U.S. cruise seaports, Mayor Daniella Levine Cava’s call to action to restart cruising, CDC collaboration, on-port testing, vaccination, and emergency transport for crew members and passengers, Cruise Sector Rallies, and COVID-19 discounts on lay berth fees, harbor fees, and rent waivers to provide relief and safe harbor for our cruise partners. These efforts afforded the County’s Port and its cruise partners the time necessary to recover from a complete halt in operations and to save thousands of jobs in the maritime industry.

In prior years, the CHSP also included participation from the United Way of the Big Bend; however, in 2016 the United Way withdrew from the CHSP and established its own separate process for allocating funding to local human service agencies. As a result, in 2018, Leon County and the City of Tallahassee entered into a new agreement through which both agencies restated their mutual commitment to the CHSP and substantially reformed and enhanced the process to provide greater funding stability for the human services agencies addressing citizens’ most critical needs in the community.

In a community land trust (CLT) model, the ownership of a home is separated from ownership of the land on which the home sits. A nonprofit organization serving as the CLT acquires, manages, and retains ownership of the land. The CLT sells the home or rents the multi-family housing development units located on that land to lower income households, and the land is preserved under a 99-year ground lease held by the CLT. Because the land is leased by the CLT and held separately from the home, the price of the home is limited to the value of the structure which ensures that the home remains affordable in perpetuity. In March 2020, Leon County and the City of Tallahassee designated the Tallahassee Lenders’ Consortium to serve as the CLT. In the short time since the program has been in operation, the County has donated four parcels to the CLT, designated five additional parcels for future donation, is currently completing construction on the first CLT home with a sale to a low-income household anticipated in the coming months, and is scheduled to begin construction on eight additional units in mid-2022.",Awarded

While other organizations were beginning to wind down their COVID-19 related flexibility, Coconino County received honest and heartfelt employee feedback that employees continued to face challenges. Each person’s pandemic journey has been unique, and the wide range of supports approved by the Coconino County Board of Supervisors reflected the diversity of experience.

In delivering these clinics, the PHLT combined existing resources (such as the venue, a large, multi-purpose facility) with an innovative new four-step vaccine-delivery protocol to make these clinics available to people from throughout the area.  Additionally, the involvement of the residents of Council Bluffs and Pottawattamie County proved essential here; indeed, to a great extent, the clinics were staffed, delivered, and supported by the local volunteer, non-profit, and business communities—along with elected officials, and employees from other County departments.

The lack of available resources, services, and law enforcement training over the years has effectively led to the criminalization of individuals suffering from SMIs/SUDs.  

In 2018, Cuyahoga County recognized this problem in its own jail and formed a stakeholder group to address the issue.  The group conducted a study which showed that individuals suffering from SMIs/SUDs accounted for over a third of the county’s jail population, and their length of stay in the jail was nearly double the average of that entire population.

The Diversion Center was developed as a solution to keep individuals out of the criminal justice system and connect them with the treatment options they need and deserve.  The intended client population was low-level, nonviolent misdemeanor offenders who are more appropriately served in a therapeutic facility in lieu of jail.  Cuyahoga County recognized the need of these services by other residents and expanded eligibility criteria beyond criminal justice interaction within the first 6 months of opening.  The Center offers clients various services that include assessment, detox, medication, counseling, and referrals to other community organizations.

This evidence-based approach has been proven to reduce recidivism, increase economic self-sufficiency, and decrease overall criminal justice operation costs in the process.  The Center – the first of its kind in the State of Ohio – opened on May 3, 2021, and has served 211 clients in its first ten months.

Outdoor grows have increased from below 200 in early 2020 to over 1200 sites in late 2021. The majority of these grows operate in the County's desert region due to abundant and inexpensive vacant land available in these areas. The increase in outdoor grows has contributed to the increase in crime in many of these desert communities as criminal organizations have found a new revenue source.

While these residents were working their best to keep up with rent, many were facing pending or coming evictions and landlords threatening to force them out of their current housing, making it necessary to provide them with legal and rental assistance.

To solve this problem, the team came together to create the Rapid Response Eviction Assistance Program (RREAP).  The program was designed to respond to the housing crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic by mediating disagreements between tenants and property owners. The parties were able to construct payment plans, temporary rent reductions, deferred payments or other creative solutions to prevent evictions and ultimately homelessness. This program gave legal teams the flexibility to be able to directly negotiate with landlords via staff funded by COVID 19 dollars and at the same time pay the landlords directly, on the spot, any settlement agreements on behalf of the clients. Due to this swift payment ability, many landlords were settling for reduced rental amounts and also agreeing to stop eviction proceedings.

Unfortunately, support is siloed, resulting in each agency having an incomplete view the individuals and families it serves and making it difficult to holistically assess their needs. This leads to gaps in care, redundancy, and poor outcomes.

The ultimate goal of the initiative is to address pervasive racial and health equity gaps in the community through improved care coordination, case management, access to services, program evaluation, and research.  

The Data Exchange was designed primarily to improve services to people, but also to improve the ability of workers to perform their jobs and to support management decision-making. The Exchange allowed community partners to get data for the services provided by CSD.

The fire entered Solano in the morning of August 18, 2020 and gave rural residents – many of who were elderly, veterans, and disabled -- just minutes to gather belongings, and leave, not knowing the fate of their property, homes, or animals left behind.   

In the aftermath of this destructive fire, Solano County employees developed an innovative outreach and reentry program known as the LNU Fire Survivor Outreach Program.  In keeping with direction from the Solano County Board of Supervisors, the program prioritized expediency and compassion in returning fire survivors to their properties and was critical to the success of the entire recovery effort.  The program focused first on outreach and finding current contact information for hundreds of displaced property owners, returning owners to their properties safely, educating survivors on options to get their properties cleaned of debris to allow for rebuilding, maintaining safety during pandemic conditions and doing all processes in a compassionate manner to reduce further trauma.
 
After 14 months, Solano County staff completed administering the two-phase disaster debris removal program to successfully clear all 501 fire-affected properties for rebuilding. The community’s resilience and the success of the Solano Survivor Outreach program is demonstrated by the issuance of 84 building permits and 134 in-progress permits.
